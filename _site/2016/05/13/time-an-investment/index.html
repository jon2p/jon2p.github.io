      <p>A few weeks ago, I found myself in the middle of my boxing training session. Instead of the usual dose of educational work that would drill an attacking pattern into my head, the focus of the second session was for continuous repetition of a set of four attacking patterns I’d learned the day before. “How many punches can you throw in a round” was never a question asked. It was assumed I’d punch the mits non-stop. I’d punch the mits non-stop for six three minute rounds. This was on top of running my usual three and a half miles in the morning, the morning training session, and the excruciatingly difficult calisthenics that followed. This was not a day for the light of heart. Yet, I looked forward to it.<!--more--></p>

<p>When you wish to improve, when you start on the course to improvement, there are hard days and there are easy days. When you first start on this course, there are many more hard days. Then, they become more and more infrequent as you progress. This is because new facets of the skill become easier to learn due to previous acquisition. You must pour the foundation before building the first floor. Once that first floor is built, it’s easier to build the second and the third. The more floors you build, the easier it is to build the next one because you are now familiar with the building plan. This is especially true if all the floors you build are laid out exactly the same. But what happens when someone wants to put an addition on that deviates from the work done before it? What happens when you encounter a new skill set you must acquire and it seems entirely dissimilar to what you have been doing? You enter a place I’ve come to affectionately call “The Crucible.”</p>

<p><img src="http://moss-gorilla1.cloudvent.net/img/posts/kungfu.jpg" alt="Kung-Fu" /></p>

<p>“The Crucible” isn’t from that play by Arthur Miller or that so-so flick starring Daniel Day Lewis and a surprisingly plain looking Winona Ryder. Merriam-Webster offers a fantastic definition of exactly what a crucible is: a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause influence, change, or development. This Crucible is present in every ability or talent a human being could wish to develop. As you endeavor to gain some mastery of a craft, this is what is supposed to happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learn and practice something new. This makes you better than a novice.</li>
  <li>Learn and practice the fundamentals. This makes you better than average.</li>
  <li>Focus on what you’re good at and excel. This makes you good.</li>
  <li>Focus on what you’re terrible at and excel. This makes you great.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is an oversimplified version of how a person improves at something. However, many people are content reaching step three because step four requires an extraordinary amount of discomfort. Very few people ever enter the top ten percent in a particular skill because most people do not want to deal with the stress it takes to get there—whether it is physical, mental, social, or spiritual.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: a great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something. You see it all the time. Guys content being just good enough to date a girl that isn’t fat, but acts like a bitch. Athletes content being just good enough they don’t look bad. Employees that are content to be just good enough at their job to get a small raise each year. The students who are content to be just good enough to pass the class or please the teacher or whatever it is they’re looking for. This mediocrity is enough to keep you from looking like a failure, but if you’re ever compared to the big dogs you’d be blown out of the water. That’s fine, sure, but we here are in the business of excellence, of winning. Most other people will never visit The Crucible.</p>

<h2 id="a-great-number-of-us-are-content-to-just-be-good-enough-at-something">A great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something</h2>

<p>I don’t blame them. The Crucible is a miserable, depressingly realistic place, free from the illusion of grandeur. It’s the path from good to great. The skills you’ve avoided working on because other parts of your skill set were good enough to get you somewhere now mock you at every repetition, at every hour you put in. You may realize you are so bad at something that is essential to your becoming great at your skill set that you totally throw in the towel. That’s okay. It’s not for everyone. Some people don’t even try. At least you tried. It’s easy to avoid The Crucible if you are afraid of the work or you have no interest in being better than what you are now. However, even if you attempt and fail, you will still have improved more than the person that challenges you for a particular position where there are fewer spots than the one you occupy.</p>

<p><strong><em>But, remember this: the only way to excel and surpass others, be great, is to make sure that you take regular visits to The Crucible.</em></strong></p>
