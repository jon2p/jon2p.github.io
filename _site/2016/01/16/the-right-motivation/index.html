      <p>As an amateur a fellow boxer asked me “Why do I box?”. He boxed because he wanted to make a lot of money. Some might find this acceptable but this is a weak reason. From a practical standpoint, getting into boxing to get rich is about as sensible as joining the police force because you want to kill bad guys: sure it happens, but it probably won’t happen to you. And if it does, the new problems you have to face are enough to make you wish you’d never started. You have to endure a lot to make a profit from boxing. There are easier ways to make money.</p>

<p>What if it takes a decade to see a notable payday, but until them you’re working some shit job? <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/3/15/2053137/examining-pay-structure-in-boxing-and-mma">What if you aren’t paid what you deserve</a>? What if the only way you can get a fight is to pay for it yourself? What if you lose a fight? Suffice to say, this guy is no longer in boxing because his passion was making money, <strong>not getting better</strong>. When his main reason for boxing evaporated, so did his presence in the sport. He didn’t even make it to 10 wins.</p>

<p>There was another time as an amateur a guy came into my gym. He took to the sport well enough and racked up 8 wins. Before his 9th fight he told me that the fight wasn’t his biggest concern. Rather, he was thinking about impressing the girls he’d invited to watch. He got knocked out cold in the 3rd round. 2 days later my coach got a text from him saying that he would no longer be boxing because he “wasn’t feeling it” anymore. This guy had been undefeated, but gets one amateur loss in front of a bunch of girls and decides he can’t do it anymore. His reasons for doing the sport–to impress some girls–was weak.</p>

<p>I’ve met a few people who’ve told me they can’t wait to prove everyone wrong who doubted them. These people think everyone is doing nothing but waiting to see if they fail or succeed. I don’t know anyone with significant accomplishments whose driving motivation is to spite other people. While I believe everyone carries a chip on the shoulder that adds some fuel to their fire, it is dangerous for the entirety furnace is powered by coals of revenge.</p>

<p>He asked me <strong>“Why do I fight?”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Mastery. I want to master the art of boxing.”</strong> My money hungry friend couldn’t appreciate my answer, so he dismissed it.</p>

<p>I don’t know if ‘Mastery’ is the best answer, but I do know when somebody new to boxing asks for my  advice, I always tell them some version of the following: <strong>Make sure that you find something about boxing that you like that can’t be taken away from you</strong>. If you’re boxing to make money, you probably won’t make a lot. If you do, it’s going to take a long time, and you’re probably going to spend most of it quickly and frivolously. If you’re boxing because you want men and women to like you, you’ll quickly find out two things: the former hate successful competitors and the latter only like you when you’re winning. If you box because you want to be liked, how are you going to handle having haters? On the flip side, if you’re boxing to prove someone wrong, what are you going to do when they stop caring or become to be a fan?</p>

<p>Mastery is a powerful motivator for me because no one can take it away; I love the feeling of getting better. The anticipation of improving is what gets me in the gym when I don’t feel like being there. This is what’s kept me around and drove me to succeed enough to make a fairly decent amount of money—at least more than the money focused majority. Making more than them is a byproduct of succeeding at something I love–not because I want a payday.</p>

<p>It’s fine to be drawn to something because you want the trappings of success. Everyone needs a <a href="https://boldanddetermined.com/9-ways-to-stay-motivated-every-day/">motivation to start something</a>. It’s usual to encounter this mindset in the beginner but as they mature their reasons for doing a thing should mature as well. I’ve been using boxing as an example but this applies to everything.</p>

<p>If you get into something because you think it’ll make you more money, make people like you or piss them off, you’ll have problems. When you encounter the natural difficulties that arise during the pursuit of a worthwhile goal, these reasons will not be enough to keep you going. That’s because anything that can be taken from you is effectively a carrot on a stick. If I dangle the carrot of fortune or fame in front of you, then you’ll go for a while but you’ll be like a drug addict chasing a fix.</p>

<p>Drug addicts only do what is necessary to get their fix. The longer they go without a hit, the stronger the cravings get and the more they’ll be willing to do in order to get high. If something external is what motivates, or even controls you internally, you’ll never stick it out when the hard times come. You’ll do what needs to be done to get a fix, and that’ll be it.</p>

<p><strong>For long term goals, you must find your motivation independent of external things</strong>. This is not an idea steeped in mysticism or one that requires deep introspection. This perspective is practical and there is a way to develop internal motivation.</p>

<p><a href="http://illimitablemen.com/2015/10/22/how-to-be-happy/">How to Build Internal Motivation</a></p>

<p><strong>First, understand that it is alright to be drawn to a field for superficial reasons</strong>. I’m sure professional sports team rosters are full of guys who initially just wanted to be <a href="http://thequintessentialman.com/stop-trying-too-hard-to-be-cool/">cool or rich</a>. There are probably more than a few doctors and lawyers who were originally drawn in by the prospect of a big pay-check. However, the greedy nature of human beings means that many other people are drawn to a pursuit for the same reasons. As things become more difficult (and they ALWAYS do), if your motivations don’t transform into something personal it won’t be long before competition forces you out of you out of your arena.</p>

<p>I often see this in boxing. What most people don’t know is that there is no formal process to becoming a professional boxer. Any person can fill out some forms, get a physical, get on a fight card and get paid a very low amount to fight. Compare this to every other sport where a person spends a considerable amount of a time training and competing against other amateurs before being SELECTED by a professional sports team. This means there’s lots of guys in boxing who call themselves “pros” but its in name only. Instead of suffering through years of fighting amateur, fighting for free and learning to love the craft, they instead doom themselves to be victories for guys who developed these aspects in the amateurs. These guys would be better off going pro only once they’d taken the time fight for free, developed a love for the sport and learned the game.</p>

<p><strong>Second, realize that at its most basic, internal motivation is an addiction</strong>. People talk about runner’s high. Chasing that feeling is what keeps a person running daily, for miles, even when they don’t want to. This feeling is not restricted to the sport of running. Once you start working out, you feel immensely better assuming you’re doing it the right way (i.e., not taking a bunch of pictures for Instagram), then you’re going to be incredibly motivated by the feeling you get.</p>

<p>At the beginning this addiction isn’t strong enough by itself to drive you, but what you put your mind on is what grows. If you focus on the feeling you get each day, soon your hunger for that feeling will grow into a monster that demands to be fed and progress becomes effortless. On the flipside, if you only focus on the external rewards, you will grow increasingly frustrated with each passing day because your mind is focused on what you <em>currently</em> lack. If you write for money, or study something because of how much it pays or get into the boxing ring to impress people this is all your mind stays focused on. <strong>Eventually you will quit</strong>. I would imagine this is why all the prominent bloggers caution against blogging for money in much the same way I caution a young fighter about getting into boxing to impress people. There are easier ways to achieve your external goals and sooner or later, you’ll realize that and hate yourself.</p>

<p>Following this reasoning to its natural conclusion reveals something powerful. People are basically motivated by three things: resources, vanity and reproductive opportunities. This is expected and acceptable. What is surprising is how quickly motivation dissipates upon attainment of one of these things. There a few things that ruin a dedicated athlete faster than the money, women, fortune and fame. The fact that some guys are capable of getting to the point where they can temporarily cash in on their hard work via indulgence is a testament to the power of these basic drives.</p>

<p>In the Hindu religion there is the idea of a “Siddha”. A Siddha is a being who is has a achieved a high level of spiritual and physical development, essentially becoming an enlightened being. On the path to enlightenment, a Siddha gains various powers such as flying, telepathy, immortality, etc. However, if at any point in his development he gets distracted by his new powers, his development will cease. Not only will it cease, but he will deteriorate until he is worse than when he started. This is a powerful analogy to the danger of doing things simply for tangible benefit.</p>

<p>Even if you achieve high enough level of ability to gain material desires, focusing on them will derail your development. For some people this is an acceptable path—to be a flash in the pan, then fade away after their 15 minutes of fame. If that is your attitude it’s unlikely you’ll get far, Even if you do, I don’t endorse mediocre processes even when they occasionally produce superior outcomes. Remember: <em>even a broken clock is right twice a day, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use batteries because you’re cheap</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Not only will it cease, but he will deteriorate until he is worse than when he started.</strong></p>

<p>Seeking mastery of a thing is a process of enlightenment. <a href="http://qcurtius.com/2016/01/12/unleashing-the-creative-forces-in-you/">Developing one’s natural gifts</a> leads to enlightenment. Self-development <a href="http://fiercegentleman.com/necessity-impossible/">in the face of a difficult task</a> that will transform you into something better is a path to enlightenment. This enlightenment is not necessarily spiritual in nature, but it allows you to transcend mortal desires to instead seek something psychologically sublime. The basic motivations are a wonderful spark, but a spark is short lived power that is meant to be replaced by more sustainable fuel.</p>

<p>Seeking personal enlightenment in the pursuit of your worthy goal is how motivation is fueled for the long term. People will hate or love you. They may never see you. Money comes and goes. You may never make any. Groupies are abundant, but soon run dry when you’re not longer on top. Seeking your own enlightenment is the only way to lift yourself above competition and then transcend it.</p>
