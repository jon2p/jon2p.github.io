      <p>I get a surprisingly amount of private messages, through various channels, asking about different things. Here are some of the questions I’ve received recently along with my answers.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-study-schedule">Do you have a study schedule?</h2>

<p>So here’s a general study tip. Chunks and clusters. I can not survive if I don’t do this. The idea is simple. Break what you’re learning down into 50 minute blocks of study. Make sure each block illuminates your understanding in some why–you can’t just stare at the page. Work some problems with a solution manual, work through example, prove a theorem, write some pseudo code, whatever. The main idea is that you spend that 50 minute chunk actively solving the problem. None of that passive shit of highlighting or going over problems in your head. You want to make your study sessions count. That is the best way. If you do that, you really won’t need a schedule. You’ll naturally fall into one. Just make sure that you take breaks at the 50 min mark. This will not only give you a break, but force you to focus for the entirely of the sessions. Also, stay away from the internet and your phone while studying.</p>

<h2 id="what-tips-would-you-give-to-your-younger-self-to-improve-your-success-in-terms-of-school--physical-fitness">What tips would you give to your younger self to improve your success in terms of school &amp; physical fitness?</h2>

<p>My general advice for improving in school and fitness will be difficult to implement, but if you do then you seriously will have a ridiculously fun time in your 20’s. And 30’s. My basic advice is don’t worry too much about the party culture going on around you. It looks fun, with lots of loose chicks and alcohol flowing, but you want to spend your time getting into the top 10%. Trust me–you can ALWAYS date 18 year olds. It should get easier though. Ignore dudes who start having trouble in their 20’s because they’ll didn’t spend the time getting into the gym and building up their skill set so their money could be right. You’ll be doing this so that right around 24 you’ll start to leave the masses behind.</p>

<p>Now I’m not saying to not go out and party, but you are fucking up if you can’t maintain sick grades while learning AND go out every night. Either you are not sufficiently challenged or you’re just scraping by. Believe me, you don’t want to just scrape by. So my general advice is to work very hard at your craft and your body, ignoring many nights that your peers will be wasting theirs, and watch how magically more options you have than the average guy starting at about 22.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-socialize-better-i-find-the-books-covering-the-topic-is-crap-and-still-stuck-to-get-how-socialization-really-works-the-money-and-business-thing-im-working-on-it-last-year-i-lost-more-than-50-pounds-i-can-do-things-on-my-own-but-still-stuck-at-socialization">How can I socialize better? I find the books covering the topic is crap, and still stuck to get how socialization really works. The “money and business” thing, I’m working on it. last year I lost more than 50 pounds, I can do things on my own, but still stuck at socialization.</h2>

<p>When it comes to socializing, you can go two ways.</p>

<p>1) Become part of a community that centers around things you are naturally passionate about.</p>

<p>2) Become part of a community and develop passion for what they are all about.</p>

<p>In other words, you either seek out groups of people that have interests like yours or you develop interests that another group has. Obviously I’d recommended the the first path since its much easier. However, the second path has its merits. Mainly, if you do it right, you’ll end up with a new set of interests, hobbies, abilities and contacts. Now remember;  I’m not talking about a bunch of a dudes that meet every Sunday to booze and watch football. Fuck that noise. I was about that life at one point, but I’ve seen the light.  Unless you’re doing that with your childhood buddies as part of bonding and relationship upkeep, you’ll end up lame. You don’t want to be lame because no one wants to be friends with lame people.</p>

<p>Ok, so those are the basics. Find people to socialize with. Once you do that, getting people to like you is pretty simple and also presents a binary set of options. You can either</p>

<p>1) Present yourself as the unselfish expert</p>

<p>2) Present yourself as the eager, but under informed newbie</p>

<p>The unselfish expert works if you find a group of people doing things you are already doing. Naturally, you’ll enter the group with a base of knowledge that others in the group will find useful. And since you’ll be unselfish (but dedicated), you’ll get a lot of people interested in you and from there you leverage it into contacts.</p>

<p>If you go the other way, then it still requires a bit of dedication to your new group but now you are asking questions. You are the new guy. People like the new guy. The trick is to you use whatever you take and show that you taking the advice of your new group, People love when a person takes their advice. Its how you establish bonds with people, demonstrating that you actively listen to them and trust what they say. Whatever you do, don’t be the guy that never listens and only complains. People really hate that guy. You want to be liked.</p>

<p>So, those are the basics.</p>
