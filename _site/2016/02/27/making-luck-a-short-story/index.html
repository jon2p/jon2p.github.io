      <p>Everyone already knows about the more obvious benefits gained from practicing the sweet science—great physical training, confidence that you can defend yourself in an unarmed conflict, and the money. Sure there are some trade-offs—permanent injury or loss of life, for example–but it’s like the old saying goes: no guts, no glory. However, there are ways in which this sport has enriched and improved my life that I did not anticipated. This post is being penned a few hours after I sustained a cut in sparring that causes me to pull out of a fight I was training for. As I sit here thinking about the money I lost, I figured I’d use it as a little inspiration and write about luck.</p>

<p>I give the role luck plays its proper respect. Most people either give luck too much credit or believe they control everything and luck has no role. Both of these perspectives are incorrect. Someone once asked me how I define luck.  I figure it’s something like this: Events happen that you have no control over. How they affect you is luck. If it’s a good effect, it’s good luck and if it’s bad it’s bad. Individual perspective is all that matters. The same event can be good or bad depending on where you stand. Let me give you two examples of this from my amateur boxing days. I actually just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gYudoZyvE4">told this story in an interview</a> which is one of the reasons I was inspired for this post.</p>

<p>For the last two years of my amateur boxing career I was paid a handsome monthly stipend, given my own apartment in Los Angeles and was flown around the country to fight only the best. I even had a chef and housecleaning. Someone invested in my development and it was wonderful. This is not something that happens to 99 percent of amateur boxers. Yes, I trained hard to get this opportunity. To get consideration to be part of this wonderful program, I had to beat one Dominic Breazeale who is 6’7” and eventually went on to represent the United States in the Olympics. These are the things I had control over.</p>

<p>What I did not control was the drawing at the 2011 National Golden Gloves. The random drawing could have paired me with anyone in the country. Someone that I couldn’t have beat. Someone that wasn’t from California. Someone that was from California but was not sponsored by the same group that would eventually fund me. But it didn’t.  Luck paired me up to fight Dominic Breazeale the night of April 25th, 2011. I won the fight 4-1 and went on to finish in the semi-finals of that tournament. I had control over this but luck put me on the good end of an event I had no control of (the drawing)</p>

<p>Fast forward a year to the 2012 USA Men’s National Championships. I had been training hard for a over a year in Los Angeles, fighting and sparring some of the best from around the world. The group that Dominic and I were with paid to send us to the site of the National Championships in Ft. Carson, CO 3 weeks early for altitude adjustment. When you’re boxing a mile above sea level, this is a significant advantage. However, my body did not take too well to the cold and altitude and I become incredibly ill just days before I was scheduled to fight. Fevers, chills, fatigue, the whole nine yards. Here’s the crazy thing: in that condition—as long as no one knew I was sick—I could have beaten about 85 percent of the field. But if the very first person you are set to fight not only demands your best, but KNOWS that you’re sick because you’ve been training with him for the past 3 weeks, then it’s a different story. As luck would have it, I drew Dominic again in the first round. It was competitive, but I simply did not have it and the fight was stopped in the 3rd round.</p>

<p>The rest is history. Dominic sweeps the field and qualifies for the Olympics. I don’t know if I would have won the tournament or even beaten him had I not been sick, but it played a significant role in the outcome—almost as much as the initial drawing that paired us on the first day. This is how luck works. There is something you can’t control—whether it be the drawing of numbers, a position in a tournament or the location of a person who can benefit your life—and you benefit from the outcome. Quite literally right place, right time. But that’s just one part of it. You have to be ready to benefit.</p>

<p>My 2011 Golden Glove drawing would have meant nothing if I had not built the requisite skills to overcome the challenge. Those same skills which impressed Dominic’s financial backers enough to invest in me as well. I’ve come to believe that it is truly impossible to control any outcome. All you can do are things that increase the probability of your desired outcome. As I write this, I think of all the necessary precautions we took during sparring, but cuts happen. This close to a fight, not many athletic commissions would clear me to fight with a fresh cut. Even if they did, one good hit could bust it wide open.</p>

<p>Nothing is certain. Nothing is entirely up to chance. The show goes on either way. Your preparation may decide if you are the one on the stage or merely the spectator. Or then again, maybe it won’t. The only thing you can control is yourself. When an event happens, you can put yourself on the good side of it instead of being blindsided by the bad. Victoria amat curam.</p>
