Escalation of force. The standard of force continuum. Rules of engagement. Regardless of the name it goes by the concept is the same: use no more force than necessary to neutralize opposition. There is a beautiful poem of sorts in martial arts that sums up this idea neatly.</p>

<p>“It is better to avoid than to block,
It is better to block than to strike,
It is better to strike than to hurt,
It is better to hurt than to maim,
It is better to maim than to kill,
It is better to kill than to be killed,
All life is precious and none can be replaced”</p>

<p>You do what you have to do to stop someone from hurting you, but no more than that. Compassionate aggression. Damage control. Do just enough to stop your opponent from hurting you. Force escalation is practiced to avoid damage that could ultimately result in an unnecessary fatality. For the less compassionate in the audience–the ones all about throwing blows in a vocal confrontation, stomping a dude out that’s already down, or even dumping a box of bullets into a guy that got the best of you–there is a more practical reason for following this code. If you can’t justify your use of force in a court of law, then you could get anything from aggravated assault to manslaughter. The length of time varies, but jail is jail and all of you reading this should be saying “fuck that!”</p>

When faced with any type of opposition, there is one thing you can do that will always make winning significantly easier.</p>

<p>I have used this tool in my chess games, my boxing matches, with bullies when I was younger, and with bosses and coworkers who may have been annoying or stifling. It works in street fights and it works in civil negotiations.</p>

<p>The beauty of this particular thing is that, while having skill and technique help, it is not necessary to be successful when using it.</p>

<p>While success may not be guaranteed (are there ever any guarantees in life?), you will come out of many situations with the upper hand—if not decidedly victorious—if you do this one thing when you can do nothing else.</p>

<p>What is this magically simple technique that anyone, regardless of the level of skill they face in their opposition, can use to give themselves a better chance of victory?</p>

Boxing is a poor man’s sport; most of us come from the ghetto to the ring. It’s a natural transition.</p>

<p>In the hood, if you’re willing to commit violence, you get respect. In boxing, the most violent man is usually the winner and the winner gets respect.</p>

<p>Even the loser gets respect if he fights hard and brings the heat. But unlike the street, there are rules in a boxing match.</p>

So it’s time to beat this horse again even though its been killed numerous times. At the very least we’re going to make sure it thinks long and hard before it resurrects itself for another round. My unique perspective on this issue is that I am actually in college as an adult. I fully realize there are many successful people that majored in non-stem subjects just as there are unemployed engineers (somewhere, I’m sure). But I like to play the odds that are in my favor.</p>

<p>If you aren’t planning to major in a STEM (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) field you should not go to college. Even if you plan on majoring in certain STEM topics (biology or anything that can remotely be considered a social science), you should skip out. College is a raw deal for most people and here’s why:</p>

A few weeks ago, I found myself in the middle of my boxing training session. Instead of the usual dose of educational work that would drill an attacking pattern into my head, the focus of the second session was for continuous repetition of a set of four attacking patterns I’d learned the day before. “How many punches can you throw in a round” was never a question asked. It was assumed I’d punch the mits non-stop. I’d punch the mits non-stop for six three minute rounds. This was on top of running my usual three and a half miles in the morning, the morning training session, and the excruciatingly difficult calisthenics that followed. This was not a day for the light of heart. Yet, I looked forward to it.</p>
