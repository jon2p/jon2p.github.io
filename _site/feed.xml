        <title>Don&#39;t Make Enemies For Free</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumbnail-img&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51s6y4a3s3L._SX338_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&quot; /&gt;
Escalation of force. The standard of force continuum. Rules of engagement. Regardless of the name it goes by the concept is the same: use no more force than necessary to neutralize opposition. There is a beautiful poem of sorts in martial arts that sums up this idea neatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is better to avoid than to block,
It is better to block than to strike,
It is better to strike than to hurt,
It is better to hurt than to maim,
It is better to maim than to kill,
It is better to kill than to be killed,
All life is precious and none can be replaced”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do what you have to do to stop someone from hurting you, but no more than that. Compassionate aggression. Damage control. Do just enough to stop your opponent from hurting you. Force escalation is practiced to avoid damage that could ultimately result in an unnecessary fatality. For the less compassionate in the audience–the ones all about throwing blows in a vocal confrontation, stomping a dude out that’s already down, or even dumping a box of bullets into a guy that got the best of you–there is a more practical reason for following this code. If you can’t justify your use of force in a court of law, then you could get anything from aggravated assault to manslaughter. The length of time varies, but jail is jail and all of you reading this should be saying “fuck that!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So aside from the practical implications–like staying out of prison–there is another reason you don’t want to overdue it when you take down opposition in your life. Every action in human affairs provokes a reaction of unknown force that is limited only by the power of those to react. There are times when you have to block, hurt, maim or maybe even kill. This could be in business, interpersonal relationships or daily life. Figurative and literal situations apply. But if you focus on achieving your objective instead of destroying the other person, then you might save yourself the wrath of new a enemy. On the other hand, he still might hate you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the risk you take whenever you block someones path or strike them down. Even if it’s necessary, you never meet a villain that feels like he needs to be stop. But sometimes the villain can become your ally. A crushed rival will remember not only how you beat him, but how you behaved once your hand was raised in victory. You’ve already won! There is no need to throw salt in a lethal wound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how many people make enemies in situations where nothing is gained at all. You might have to strike an opponent, but you don’t have to maim or kill him. This increases the chances that he comes for revenge. Or his friends may come for revenge. Hell knoweth no fury than an opponent driven by hatred rather than necessity. No one knows the future. Overly shamed or overly hurt opponents become enemies who will use their own methods and resources to balance the emotional scales. No man knows the hour and intensity of his own revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youve-already-won-there-is-no-need-to-throw-salt-in-a-lethal-wound&quot;&gt;You’ve already won! There is no need to throw salt in a lethal wound.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have to stop an opponent, do what’s necessary and respect your adversary. If he becomes a bitter enemy anyway, there is nothing you could have done. Just don’t make an enemy out of the fallen if you don’t have to. The difference between those who graciously accept defeat and those who plot revenge is often how the victor handles the temporary shift of power. The enemy you avoid making today could be your ally tomorrow. Or your executioner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Becoming A Problem To Solve Your Problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumbnail-img&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/rubiks-cube.png&quot; /&gt;
When faced with any type of opposition, there is one thing you can do that will always make winning significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used this tool in my chess games, my boxing matches, with bullies when I was younger, and with bosses and coworkers who may have been annoying or stifling. It works in street fights and it works in civil negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this particular thing is that, while having skill and technique help, it is not necessary to be successful when using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While success may not be guaranteed (are there ever any guarantees in life?), you will come out of many situations with the upper hand—if not decidedly victorious—if you do this one thing when you can do nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this magically simple technique that anyone, regardless of the level of skill they face in their opposition, can use to give themselves a better chance of victory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;become-a-problem&quot;&gt;Become a Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is this: become a problem. Or rather, become a problem in such a way that your opposition will flounder, clueless, attempting to effectively deal with you. By definition, you are already a problem; your existence is in the way of what someone else wants. After all, it wouldn’t be much of a fight if there wasn’t someone to struggle against and, let’s be honest, you wouldn’t be negotiating if you were already in a position to get everything you want without making concessions to another party. And, sometimes, you show up to the gunfight and your ammo is not quite what you expected. You’ve got to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could spell it out for you, but I’ve always found examples to be an effective teaching method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play chess, one of the most mentally demanding games; some of the most annoying and strange situations in a chess game arise when your opponent makes some… interesting… moves that force you to reconsider your strategy. There is an expected line of play then your opponent deviates sharply from it. He moves this, you move that, he moves this, and so on. While it’s not exactly scripted, over time history has shown that certain lines of play are more effective than others. But when someone deviates from the “script,” does something out of the ordinary, you need to shift your thinking from what’s routine and expected in order to deal with this new play. This idea—forcing someone to deal with what they weren’t expecting to deal with—is key and will be revisited shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also glean insight into this idea by considering how it works in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, my fighting is conducted in a manner more condoned by the public, in the ring. But, when I was younger, I was involved in more than a few street fights. I was not a violent kid naturally, but when you grow up in circumstances like I did, you quickly learn that not only are there some people that just like being ornery assholes, these people expect you kowtow to them in fear. When I was about ten or eleven years old, I got a lesson in dealing with these assholes. Back then, day after day, a new neighborhood kid would pick on me until this one day my mom had enough. She marched me back to the playground I had just been run out of and issued an open challenge to every single kid that bothered me. I think I ended up fighting five kids that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d think that’d be enough, but I think I got my ass kicked so they didn’t take me seriously. However, each time one of them started anything, we went through the same process again. If one kid started a fight, I ended up challenging every kid around that day and they either backed down or we got into a scuffle where they were beat up. Very few people enjoy being beaten, and they weren’t some of the few. It got to the point that, by the end of that summer, people were actively checking other people that attempted to fight me because it just wasn’t worth the cost of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://edlatimore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fighting.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;This dude better become a problem REAL fast&quot; /&gt;
This dude better become a problem REAL fast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the same thing in boxing. There was a fighter in our amateur circuit that was a big fan of holding. I mean, a little hugging is normal, but this guy took it to extremes. He’d sneak little annoying shots in while he’s doing it, making the whole fight an ugly affair. I can’t tell you how many times this style of fighting frustrated the hell out of his opponents. They got so frustrated they’d abandon the ability to concentrate effectively, thus ending up the losers. I don’t think this guy is one of the most skilled fighters ever, but he certainly had an impressive list of accolades. Most people simply don’t want to—or can’t—fight that kind of fight so they cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therein lies the reason why becoming a basic, unique problem works in almost any situation. Very few people have the ability to adjust to problems in real time. They expect things to go a certain way and when there is a deviation from what they anticipated, their minds go to shit. Now, if you come against someone that is capable of making such adjustments—and these creative, dynamic individuals are few and far between in most arenas—there’s nothing you could have done to win anyway. But sometimes, it’s a good to test someone’s tolerance for an unexpected response by being problematic in an unfamiliar way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Courage In Violence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumbnail-img&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/boxing.png&quot; /&gt;
Boxing is a poor man’s sport; most of us come from the ghetto to the ring. It’s a natural transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hood, if you’re willing to commit violence, you get respect. In boxing, the most violent man is usually the winner and the winner gets respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the loser gets respect if he fights hard and brings the heat. But unlike the street, there are rules in a boxing match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a sparring session with two rival gyms. Things were getting heated. One of the dudes sparring got caught with a shot he didn’t like and it escalated quickly. In an instant it looked more like a brawl than a match, with members from each side jumping in. Fortunately, the coaches got things under control before they got too out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Coach then told something I’ll never forget. He said,“If you do this shit in the street, someone’s probably gonna get killed. You kill someone in the street and you’re going to jail. But if you do it in the ring, you ain’t goin’ nowhere. Shit, they gonna clap and cheer your name if you do it during the fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, everyone calmed down and the sparring session continued. The dudes were cool after that. It takes a lot of courage, skill, and discipline to get the best of a man when he is prepared and trained and ready for you and you have to meet him on equal footing. That doesn’t happen when you run up to someone and sucker punch them or take out a gun and shoot them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being prepared, ready for the ring is teaching a man to face his fears head on because the only advantages he can be confident of are found in training and preparation. Taking out that gun, running up to a man on the street to beat him down is a coward’s way, a moment where he faces no real possibility of defeat. That shit works if you have to go to war or save your family, but for building true character you need to build courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violence inherent to a boxing match is an excellent method to build courage. There is always a winner and a loser. Even when the judges declare a bullshit draw, everyone knows that someone won and someone lost. It’s only through facing the possibility of getting hurt, losing or dying, that you can ever build actual courage. There ain’t a lot of things left in the world that lets a man face those fears and grow from facing them. Boxing is one of the few remaining forms of violence that lets you live another day while developing your courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violence inherent to a boxing match is an excellent method to build courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those kids at the session got into a brawl because they had learned to be violent, to take the coward’s way. Sometimes, that shit is necessary—especially in the streets. But if you wanna be better than the streets, you gotta learn to be courageous. If you want to be courageous in the face violence—where another man can legally kill you and be applauded—you can be courageous anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Reasons You Should Not Go To College</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumbnail-img&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/student-loans.jpg&quot; /&gt;
So it’s time to beat this horse again even though its been killed numerous times. At the very least we’re going to make sure it thinks long and hard before it resurrects itself for another round. My unique perspective on this issue is that I am actually in college as an adult. I fully realize there are many successful people that majored in non-stem subjects just as there are unemployed engineers (somewhere, I’m sure). But I like to play the odds that are in my favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t planning to major in a STEM (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) field you should not go to college. Even if you plan on majoring in certain STEM topics (biology or anything that can remotely be considered a social science), you should skip out. College is a raw deal for most people and here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt. On average, you’re going to borrow about 6 figures. When you combine interest and cost of living, you aren’t going to make enough to deal with that financial burden unless you have a STEM degree salary. And that’s if you can find work that relates to what you studied…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job availability. When it comes to finding jobs, there’s the good and there’s the bad of it. The good is that there are a lot of them. The bad is that you either can’t get them without STEM or trade training or you don’t want them because they don’t pay enough and/or have shitty hours. We live in an era that is tech and service industry heavy. If you aren’t involved in one of the skilled trades, you are almost certainly going to end up in the service industry or doing some low level administrative work. Either way, you aren’t going to make enough money to afford much of a life AND pay off that heavy debt you took out with the hope of living the life you want to lead..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job availability, part 2. Working at a Starbucks some years ago, I learned something they don’t tell you in school. At the time, I was a 21 year old barista making 7.25 an hour. Every one of  my co-workers, with the exception of one girl younger than me, had a college degree. This was not uncommon. A lot of baristas were making 600 a month + tip with college degrees. How does this happen? Half of it’s majoring in bullshit (i.e., not STEM) and the other half is because of the over-abundance of college educated people. If everyone goes to college and earns a degree, you no longer stand out and a college degree is worth about as much to an employer as a high school diploma was maybe fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your degree needs to be in something rare and difficult (like STEM); otherwise, you end up competing for a bunch of low paying jobs because that is all that is left. The low paying jobs now have two pools of applicants—those without degrees and those with. For a host of reasons (some obvious, some not), applicants with college degrees are more highly desired. The availability of jobs in other areas becomes diluted as people overload positions that require degrees like biology and social science so they then get relegated to administrative jobs and people just keep getting bumped down. These people are bumped down until they’re baristas, barely making enough for rent with 6 figures of debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills. You need skills to pay bills. Period. College may grant you a pretty piece of paper, but it will not necessarily teach you skills. You need to learn how to fix electronics, program a computer, repair a car, do plumbing or carpentry, or speak a foreign language if you are looking for the guarantee of a decent paycheck. As the baristas I worked with learned, there are no guarantees. On the flip side, Google is famous for hiring programmers with no formal training. Skills guarantee money. A piece of paper, however nice to look at framed and hanging in your parents’ home, will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You become socially fucked. This is the reality at most colleges today: there is a ton of drinking done, everyone in your peer group lives in close proximity, and no one really learns to be social. People just sort of stumble into one another and hang out and drink together. It’s amazing how socially weak most people are when you get them away from the bar and the college scene. College will make you great at being semi-functional while holding your liquor. It won’t make you any better at networking with random people, making friends or learning how to successfully hit on girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen, there are many things you could do instead of going to college. You could learn any number of trades. You could learn programming. You could write online. Even if you lived like a bum for five years while teaching yourself music, you’d be pretty solid skill-wise and be able to build a following online to sell your talent to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re charismatic you can go into sales and if you have absolutely no talent at all for anything in particular, you can enlist in the armed forces, see the world, learn some skills, and get paid decently. Though we’re regularly taught that higher education is where it’s at and an integral step to achieving your dream life, it can wreck you financially. There are options, many lucrative, that do not require a thick, pretty piece of paper signed by some old dude you’ve never met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share the knowledge with others&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Crucible</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumbnail-img&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/crucible.jpg&quot; /&gt;
A few weeks ago, I found myself in the middle of my boxing training session. Instead of the usual dose of educational work that would drill an attacking pattern into my head, the focus of the second session was for continuous repetition of a set of four attacking patterns I’d learned the day before. “How many punches can you throw in a round” was never a question asked. It was assumed I’d punch the mits non-stop. I’d punch the mits non-stop for six three minute rounds. This was on top of running my usual three and a half miles in the morning, the morning training session, and the excruciatingly difficult calisthenics that followed. This was not a day for the light of heart. Yet, I looked forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you wish to improve, when you start on the course to improvement, there are hard days and there are easy days. When you first start on this course, there are many more hard days. Then, they become more and more infrequent as you progress. This is because new facets of the skill become easier to learn due to previous acquisition. You must pour the foundation before building the first floor. Once that first floor is built, it’s easier to build the second and the third. The more floors you build, the easier it is to build the next one because you are now familiar with the building plan. This is especially true if all the floors you build are laid out exactly the same. But what happens when someone wants to put an addition on that deviates from the work done before it? What happens when you encounter a new skill set you must acquire and it seems entirely dissimilar to what you have been doing? You enter a place I’ve come to affectionately call “The Crucible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/kungfu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kung-Fu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Crucible” isn’t from that play by Arthur Miller or that so-so flick starring Daniel Day Lewis and a surprisingly plain looking Winona Ryder. Merriam-Webster offers a fantastic definition of exactly what a crucible is: a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause influence, change, or development. This Crucible is present in every ability or talent a human being could wish to develop. As you endeavor to gain some mastery of a craft, this is what is supposed to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn and practice something new. This makes you better than a novice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn and practice the fundamentals. This makes you better than average.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on what you’re good at and excel. This makes you good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on what you’re terrible at and excel. This makes you great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplified version of how a person improves at something. However, many people are content reaching step three because step four requires an extraordinary amount of discomfort. Very few people ever enter the top ten percent in a particular skill because most people do not want to deal with the stress it takes to get there—whether it is physical, mental, social, or spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem: a great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something. You see it all the time. Guys content being just good enough to date a girl that isn’t fat, but acts like a bitch. Athletes content being just good enough they don’t look bad. Employees that are content to be just good enough at their job to get a small raise each year. The students who are content to be just good enough to pass the class or please the teacher or whatever it is they’re looking for. This mediocrity is enough to keep you from looking like a failure, but if you’re ever compared to the big dogs you’d be blown out of the water. That’s fine, sure, but we here are in the business of excellence, of winning. Most other people will never visit The Crucible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-great-number-of-us-are-content-to-just-be-good-enough-at-something&quot;&gt;A great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame them. The Crucible is a miserable, depressingly realistic place, free from the illusion of grandeur. It’s the path from good to great. The skills you’ve avoided working on because other parts of your skill set were good enough to get you somewhere now mock you at every repetition, at every hour you put in. You may realize you are so bad at something that is essential to your becoming great at your skill set that you totally throw in the towel. That’s okay. It’s not for everyone. Some people don’t even try. At least you tried. It’s easy to avoid The Crucible if you are afraid of the work or you have no interest in being better than what you are now. However, even if you attempt and fail, you will still have improved more than the person that challenges you for a particular position where there are fewer spots than the one you occupy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But, remember this: the only way to excel and surpass others, be great, is to make sure that you take regular visits to The Crucible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This was on top of running my usual three and a half miles in the morning, the morning training session, and the excruciatingly difficult calisthenics that followed. This was not a day for the light of heart. Yet, I looked forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you wish to improve, when you start on the course to improvement, there are hard days and there are easy days. When you first start on this course, there are many more hard days. Then, they become more and more infrequent as you progress. This is because new facets of the skill become easier to learn due to previous acquisition. You must pour the foundation before building the first floor. Once that first floor is built, it’s easier to build the second and the third. The more floors you build, the easier it is to build the next one because you are now familiar with the building plan. This is especially true if all the floors you build are laid out exactly the same. But what happens when someone wants to put an addition on that deviates from the work done before it? What happens when you encounter a new skill set you must acquire and it seems entirely dissimilar to what you have been doing? You enter a place I’ve come to affectionately call “The Crucible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/posts/kungfu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kung-Fu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Crucible” isn’t from that play by Arthur Miller or that so-so flick starring Daniel Day Lewis and a surprisingly plain looking Winona Ryder. Merriam-Webster offers a fantastic definition of exactly what a crucible is: a place or situation in which concentrated forces interact to cause influence, change, or development. This Crucible is present in every ability or talent a human being could wish to develop. As you endeavor to gain some mastery of a craft, this is what is supposed to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn and practice something new. This makes you better than a novice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn and practice the fundamentals. This makes you better than average.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on what you’re good at and excel. This makes you good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on what you’re terrible at and excel. This makes you great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an oversimplified version of how a person improves at something. However, many people are content reaching step three because step four requires an extraordinary amount of discomfort. Very few people ever enter the top ten percent in a particular skill because most people do not want to deal with the stress it takes to get there—whether it is physical, mental, social, or spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem: a great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something. You see it all the time. Guys content being just good enough to date a girl that isn’t fat, but acts like a bitch. Athletes content being just good enough they don’t look bad. Employees that are content to be just good enough at their job to get a small raise each year. The students who are content to be just good enough to pass the class or please the teacher or whatever it is they’re looking for. This mediocrity is enough to keep you from looking like a failure, but if you’re ever compared to the big dogs you’d be blown out of the water. That’s fine, sure, but we here are in the business of excellence, of winning. Most other people will never visit The Crucible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-great-number-of-us-are-content-to-just-be-good-enough-at-something&quot;&gt;A great number of us are content to just be “good enough” at something&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame them. The Crucible is a miserable, depressingly realistic place, free from the illusion of grandeur. It’s the path from good to great. The skills you’ve avoided working on because other parts of your skill set were good enough to get you somewhere now mock you at every repetition, at every hour you put in. You may realize you are so bad at something that is essential to your becoming great at your skill set that you totally throw in the towel. That’s okay. It’s not for everyone. Some people don’t even try. At least you tried. It’s easy to avoid The Crucible if you are afraid of the work or you have no interest in being better than what you are now. However, even if you attempt and fail, you will still have improved more than the person that challenges you for a particular position where there are fewer spots than the one you occupy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But, remember this: the only way to excel and surpass others, be great, is to make sure that you take regular visits to The Crucible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
