      <p>Not only did I grow up poor, but I grew up in a fairly dangerous area as well. If you haven’t taken a trip there before, you probably know an area like this as “The Ghetto.” I’m more partial to calling them “The Projects” or “The Hood.” No matter what name you use to describe hell, things still burn there. While I accumulated <a href="/2015/10/30/5-lessons-from-growing-up-in-the-hood/">many valuable lessons and perspectives on life</a>, they came at a price that I would not wish on anyone. Say what you want about spoiled rich kids, but quality of life matters more than most people will ever want to admit when it comes to raising children. Not to mention, assholes come from all socio-economic backgrounds. The only difference between assholes from my area and an affluent one is that I couldn’t be an asshole in my new car at 16.</p>

<p>With that said, while I will never live in anything even remotely resembling a housing project again, those 18 years I spent there were formative. I learned a lot about human nature, basic survival and which personality traits and actions not only keep you safe in a den of lions. Furthermore, because I lived in the worst neighborhoods in my city, but my close friends were in some of the best, I got compare and contrast lifestyles even more. The following is an important lesson.</p>

<h2 id="being-willing-to-fight-is-more-important-than-actually-fighting">Being Willing to Fight is More Important Than Actually Fighting</h2>

<p>One of the most annoying things I remember from my childhood until I went to a high school across town. There was always someone looking for a reason to fight. When I was younger, <a href="/2015/11/17/why-you-need-problems/">I used to think I had a sign on my back for this type of shit</a>, but in retrospect, I think I fought no more than slightly above average. Just for note, slightly above average probably means somewhere along the lines of once a week.</p>

<p>However, I noticed a pattern. One kid would find some reason to fight and act on that reason. The target of the aggression could respond in one of two ways: run or fight. In a high aggression environment like the ghetto, running from a fight is the worst thing you can do. For starters, there’s the obvious problem: you gain a reputation for weakness and that reputation will be challenged over and over again. Eventually it might get pretty nasty. Secondly, ghettos are small places and everyone knows where you live. They’ll just find you again—either at home or at school—to deal with the “problem” they had with you. In many ways, it’s not even a legitimate response so much as it is delaying the inevitable fight.</p>

<p>Choosing to fight wasn’t much better. If you won the fight, they’d just come back later with a group. If you lost the fight, you’d just be tormented and eventually be challenged again because losing a fight displays weakness. At this point it’s just choosing between two evils. I always chose to fight, but with a slight modification: the moment I realized the person intended to hurt me, I threw the first punch and proceeded pummel the shit out of whoever decided I was going to be their target that day. I didn’t go overboard, but I made certain that my intentions were to come out of the fight clearly ahead. Breaking even is still a loss in these kind of situations.</p>

<p><a href="/2015/11/19/forget-the-word-fair/">This didn’t prevent retaliation</a>. It was scary as hell since I knew some kids had access to guns. It didn’t even guarantee that I would win the fight. I’m not sure what my unofficial record in the street was when I was kid, but I remember being in pain and spending a lot of time wondering when if someone was going to try and fight today. However, it did accomplish something very important that made my life a little easier: anytime a person decided that I was a target, they knew there was a 100 percent chance of the encounter ending in violence. This is important and reveals a subtle difference between bullies and genuinely aggressive and violent people.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the conventional advice for dealing with bullies: just stand up to them and show you aren’t afraid. What most parents are too politically correct to teach their kids is that until you exchange blows, all you’ve shown is that you’re too lazy to run the other direction. I remember dealing with a kid that bullied me only until we got into a fight so bad I had to be pulled off of him. Standing up to them only counts if you actually get into a fight, win or lose. At that point, a bully realizes you aren’t an easy target and goes on about his business. My life would have been a lot easier if the ghetto was only full of bullies.</p>

<p>Instead, ghettos have quite a bit of aggressive kids who have a <a href="/2015/11/05/important-lessons-from-fighting-you-can-apply-to-your-life/">genuine taste for violence and dominance</a>. We’ll call them jackals. The reasons for there being large concentrations of these types of kids in the ghetto are numerous, but these are the ones who are a problem. These are the ones most likely to retaliate, to recruit groups of other like-minded individuals in making your life a living hell, and from my experience, the ones that will end up seriously hurting someone eventually. The response is still the same: strike first, talk later.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is really that simple. Jackals love a good fight and tend to put a bit more effort into trying to dominate or “bitch” you. Bullies make a go at it and are unpleasantly surprised when you show your willingness to fight. The similarities between the two are why an aggressive willingness to fight is more important than actually fighting. Bullies and Jackals are still human beings and thus operate under the same principles that the rest of civilized does. They wish to put forth as little effort as possible to reach their goals and have an aversion to pain.</p>

<p>They may want to fight, but it would be a lot easier for them if they could just control you without ever having to resort to violence. Violence might be fun, but it costs more effort than making a few threats and having you fall into line without much resistance. This, combined with the fact that resistance makes them experience pain, many times the kids that were willing to throw down were completely avoided. Strong or weak didn’t matter: there was a big white kid that could have kicked any of our 7th grade asses, but he was continually dominated by bullies because he wasn’t willing to fight.</p>

<h2 id="the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>

<p>It’s not often the outcome that is important when it comes to standing up to a potential challenger. Aggressors often pick their targets because they believe they will not fight back. Most people like this are so used to their opponents falling over at their first show of force. Even if you do not believe you can win the fight—regardless of the nature of the battle or the arena in which it takes place—attacking them right back will make many of them crumble. In this case, not only do you win a short term battle but the long term psychological advantage is now in your favor. At that point, your most powerful weapon is their fear. The best offense is a great defense.</p>
