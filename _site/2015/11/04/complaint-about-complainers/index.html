      <p>I once read that the moment you complain about a problem you forfeit any assistance the universe was going to grant you in its resolution. If your spiritual system prefers a more concrete representation of a higher power, then another idea may be more appropriate; “God helps those who help themselves.” I don’t know if I believe that God, the Universe, or “insert higher power of choice here” assists anyone personally, but I do know this—I REALLY hate people that complain.</p>

<p>In fact, the only type of people I have a stronger gag reflex for are bullies and cowards. People that bring unprovoked harm to the weak, run from anything intimidating and anyone that freely shares their personal woes; those guilty of these offenses can never be friend to me or anyone that values themselves and their time. I consider myself fairly tolerant of flaws in others, but bullies, cowards, and complainers are no allies of mine. Let’s take a more in depth examination of the latter.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/complaints---x----300-284x---.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>The line most people are in</em></p>

<p>From a practical perspective, there is some truth to the idea of the universe revoking assistance to people that complain. The main reason people complain is that their <strong>focus</strong> becomes misplaced. A complainer focuses on the problem instead of the solution. Since what is focused grows in your mind, they see more problems than solutions. There may be a remedy to what ails you right under them right under their nose, but it will most certainly be missed—which will lead to more “reasons” to complain about the problem.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the story about the guy trapped on his rood by a great flood. He prays to God to save him. A rescues helicopter and 3 boats come by, but the guy turns them down because he’s waiting for God. Well he drowns, and goes to heaven. Once there he asks God why didn’t he rescues him, to which God replies, “Well I sent a helicopter and 3 boats and you sent them away.” Not only is this story a wonder illustration of what happens when you don’t focus on solutions, it nicely demonstrates the idea of God only helping those that help themselves as well.</p>

<p>It all centers on an inability to take responsibility. This is a core trait of complainers. If complaining is a symptom, irresponsibility is the virus. Once infected, the host is likely to blame everyone and everything for their problems except themselves. Pessimistic attitudes and victim complex are soon to follow. No matter how intense the complaint is, it sends the same message: I want this situation to be better, but I don’t want to fix it myself. Now, like a young child whose life also lacks responsibility, the complainer’s life is full of wishes for a better future instead of a plan for improvement that involves work.</p>

<p>Complainers also carry with them an assumption that people who are subject to their whining actually care. Fewer things are further from the truth. Most people are so caught up in their own daily struggle and reasons to complain that anyone else’s complaints are an afterthought. This is just the tip of the iceberg that is the self-centeredness of those who complain.</p>

<p>There tends to be an extraordinary lack of empathy in the ranks of complainers. This starts with a simple slip of the mind; complainers forget that life can be a lost worse. In fact, life IS a lot worse for a lot of people forced to listen to their complaints. Lack of gratitude is part of the problem, but absence of empathy is the major reason for this. Remember, complainers genuinely believe that all of the forces in the universe have collaborated against them.</p>

<p>Empathy isn’t possible when you believe that your life has been singled out for torment because you feel special. These are the people that tell you that you could never understand their problem because it’s so unique. These people also manage to make every conversation about their current crisis, forsaking all chances to empathetically bond with another person.</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in a mood to complain about something, remember this quote, “Be kind and lower your eyes, for everyone is fighting a harder battle.” Excusing the irony that is this blog post, I pride myself on almost never complaining. This quote has been in my mind and heart for years. The idea expressed by the quote act as a powerful antidote to the complaining virus. By keeping you humble, it forces you to take the focus off of yourself. It also reminds you that not only can things get worse; they actually are for some people. The universe has not picked you out for specific torture. From now on, lower your eyes and refuse to complain about anything, even slightly. This is the way of the strong and through strength, humility and empathy.</p>
