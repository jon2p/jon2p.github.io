      <p>If you have a goal that you are trying accomplish and your drinking interferes with it, then you need to cut back or stop drinking. If you can’t, then you have a drinking problem. I’m on 23 months of not drinking so the following is straight from my heart, but it should give a framework to evaluate your own decisions and goals.</p>

<p>That’s my definition and by that definition I don’t even consider most full blown alcoholics people with drinking problems. If you have decided that you’ve done what you’re going to do in life and you want to get hammered most of your free time, that’s fine by me. This is for any level of life.</p>

<p>If you want to be nothing more than a high school drop out making 10 dollars an hour, then by all means drink up. All the time. If you’ve made a few million dollars are content just letting it ride and drinking many evenings away, then I don’t think you have a problem.</p>

<p>If you hurt people while under the influence of alcohol, you’re a criminal and you’re stupid–but I don’t think you have a problem with alcohol. Alcohol is supposed to make you dumb and dull. If you do dumb and dull shit while under it’s influence, that is not a sign of a problem. That’s a sign it’s working!</p>

<p>If are you are earnestly trying to improve your life and alcohol is interfering, then you have a drinking problem. You don’t have to get smashed all the time, and drink 15 drinks a night, but your drinking is problematic if it interferes with your aims for your life.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here. I’m not talking about lofty goals that you imagine you’ll achieve one. If you want to get down to 10 percent body fat—you’re eating all the right foods and working twice as hard as you need to in the gym—but you go out and drinking every night, then your drinking is a problem. In fact, it is THE problem.</p>

<p>If you are doing all the right things in your relationships romantic, platonic and familial relationships to make them strong and lasting, but the majority of your problems are happen when you drink—you have a drinking problem. There are some people with shitty personalities that just become worse when they drink. These people are just assholes but they don’t have problems. This is for the person who acts right most of the time when they’re sober and acts wrong most of the time when they’re drinking.</p>

<p>If you put a very real effort into a portion of life but alcohol is undoing that progress, then you need to change your relationship status with booze. Maybe your need to take a short break, maybe you drink soft drinks most of the time, or maybe you go on a permanent break, but something must change.</p>

<p>This isn’t for the people that drink all night and end up late to some job they hate to pay rent to live in a shit hole they don’t like. I’m not dropping this message for the people who had 5 kids by 25 with no means to support them anyway and maybe drinking too much is messing up the family. This definitely isn’t for the kid in college that’s majoring in bullshit that spends every night fucked up and still has a 3.9 gpa.</p>

<p>You can be a heavy drinker and maybe even be an alcoholic. But if you don’t have any other goal that you’re working towards, so the fuck what? I’m a big believer in relaxing and enjoying life if you feel you’ve earned it. But I also know that everyone ain’t gonna have the same goals me. If your goal is to make rent, chase girls and feed yourself and drinking doesn’t keep you from doing that, you’re good. If your goal is to get smashed at happy hour 5 days a week after work and your honestly content with your salary, go for it. You’ve earned it.</p>

<p>But if you are after more in your life and you find that your greatest inhibitor is alcohol, then you have to pull back off the bottle. Better to fail because you went all out than because you were nursing a hangover. Better to lose a friend because you actually pissed him off than because he finally lost patience with your drunken antics. Better to have control over your life than not.</p>
