I’m not an over religious person. I don’t know if God exists or not. That’s a matter of faith. Faith is not based on certainty. What I can say with certainty is that whether God exists or not, he does not give a damn about the outcome of a sporting event. Whether you’re part of the crowd that thinks God makes everything happen or you believe we have free will, you can’t call yourself intelligent AND believe God is a vested interest in the outcome of any sporting event. Maybe he gave a very very very small fuck about the 1936 Olympics (not giving a history lesson here so Google it if you don’t know the significance), but unlikely.

Even the most hardcore bible thumpers watch athletes thank God and they realize that he doesn’t care. Even if he does care, very few people think that God chooses sides. If God does care, he cares more in a “I’m happy no one got to meet me early” sorta way. I think most people will not disagree with this argument, including the athletes that thank God specifically for their victory. So why do so many athletes thank God after they win?

They do it because it sounds a lot better than “I put in all this work and sacrifice and today it showed. I won because I outworked the other guy.” To be fair, there are athletes who give some aspect of this speech, they almost always soften it up by thanking God first. For a group of people that works incredibly hard to excel at what they do, many athletes are averse to stating what everyone already knows: they worked hard and that’s why they won.

I think it’s an attempt to remain humble. Humility is funny because it’s considered a virtue so everyone wants it. But if you’re humble, then you downplay your achievements. The problem with being humbles comes when it is painfully (literally and figuratively) obvious that you are the one solely responsible for your success. At this point, even though it’s logical and I doubt few people would disagree, you cannot simultaneously remain humble and acknowledge your own work ethic. So the next best thing you can do is thank God.

No one is gonna argue with that. Sure, it implies that God chose your side that day, but that’s ok because&nbsp;**people would rather believe your success was the result of divine favor instead of hard work**. By thanking God, athletes are taking the focus off of their actions and instead making themselves seem particularly blessed.

This is important because people really hate to be reminded of their inadequacy. If you give up huge portions of time to bust your ass honing a craft for years and years, and then you become rich, famous or receive other special favor, then most people have to believe you got lucky. If you got lucky, it explains why they don’t have the same success even though they did not do a tenth of the work involved.

You hear this type of grumbling in day to day to living as well. Many people blame every factor but themselves for their position in life. But that’s only one factor of the sour grapes equation. They also have to come up with an explanation for why you got the nice job, or the cute girl, or the great body and they did not. They have to blame society, or their upbringing, the economy or any number of factors. By blaming them these things for their misfortune, they are simultaneously using them to give credit to your fortune.

The people who reach such great heights of achievement know this all too well. To mitigate the hate, most of them develop some system of thanking a higher power from an early point in their careers. At all levels and all degrees of ability, I see athletes thank God for their victory. Even though God has a million and one other things to worry about, hopefully of greater importance, than your team making it into the play offs. I guess when you can do things that make you look God-like, the only way to remain grounded is to say that it’s God’s fault.
