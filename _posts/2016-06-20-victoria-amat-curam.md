excerpt: "Victoria Amat Curam.\_This is Latin for “Victory loves preparation”. This is perhaps my favorite saying and a code I live by. Being smart helps and being tough keeps you in the fight, but preparation is king and keeps you from relying on might. This is why my first shirt carries this banner. <br><br> I’ve was never into the idea of putting my name on the back of shirts for guys to wear. I’m an unusual fighter this way. I don’t want people to wear a bunch of “Team Latimore” shirts. Guys who sale shirts have approached me with variations of the idea and I wasn’t a fan. If I’m going to sell something to people, I want to sell the something that is representative of the mindset and ideas that I embrace. So as they say, if you want something done then do it yourself."

**Victoria Amat Curam.**&nbsp;This is Latin for “Victory loves preparation”. This is perhaps my favorite saying and a code I live by. Being smart helps and being tough keeps you in the fight, but preparation is king and keeps you from relying on might. This is why my first shirt carries this banner.

I’ve was never into the idea of putting my name on the back of shirts for guys to wear. I’m an unusual fighter this way. I don’t want people to wear a bunch of “Team Latimore” shirts. Guys who sale shirts have approached me with variations of the idea and I wasn’t a fan. If I’m going to sell something to people, I want to sell the something that is representative of the mindset and ideas that I embrace. So as they say, if you want something done then do it yourself.

Ed Latimore is a cool sounding name. Hopefully one day people around the world know it even after I die. “Victoria Amat Curam” is a lifestyle and a mentality. People who practice it will always succeed over those who don’t. This will be true until the sun explodes and ends life as we know it. If you buy from me you’re getting a saying I hold near and dear. Victory loves preparation.

The chess knight is my favorite piece in the game. Its the only piece in the game that is not limited by what’s in front of it. It’s the only piece in the game that can jump over the opposition. It’s the piece that strikes terror into most players because through it’s careful use it can attack and defend many pieces at once. The only way to appreciate a piece with power of this magnitude is to be prepared. Victory loves preparation.

If you are a competitor in any arena–intellectual, physical or even just fighting the daily struggle of life–this is a saying that you can always think of when you aren’t sure of the next step. Relax and prepare. &nbsp;You can’t be ready for everything but you can be ready for most things. Because you’ll be prepared for the rest of what can go wrong, your brain can go on autopilot and you can focus on dealing with the new problem with great efficacy. Victoria Amat Curam.
