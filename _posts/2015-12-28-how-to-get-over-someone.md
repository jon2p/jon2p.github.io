A few weeks ago I got a tweet from a guy asking for advice or dealing with a break up. To be more precise, he couldn’t get over a girl. I think he said it had been a year since they parted ways, but I can’t remember. It wasn’t clear whether he was the dumper or the dumped, but he was having trouble.

Getting rejected by a human being we like is an incredibly difficult thing to deal with, but it happens to the best of us. You show me a person that’s never been rejected or dumped and I’ll show you a person that has never know love. There are risks in the matters of the heart, but the rewards are so great that we open up anyway. However, all things pass, nothing lasts forever, and the raging river of passion eventually turns into a stream, and then into nothing at all. That is the way of romance—eventually something causes it to end and that something will most likely not be death.

Chances are great that you are going to get dumped one day. It’s going to suck but there are ways to manage the damage.&nbsp; What I present for your consideration the next time you find yourself on the receiving end of the “I think I need some space” speech is my official break up protocol. The last time I officially broke up with someone was in 2007 after a 4 year bid upstate in the love joint. For some reason I didn’t follow this protocol and the results were predictably disastrous. But any other time I was dumped or doing the dumping I took the following steps so I know it works well.

## Bow Out Gracefully

So you just discovered that it’s not going to work out and your first reaction is volatile. You want to scream, shout, call names, shoot up malls, and strap a bomb to your chest. Calm down. Handle this situation with class and dignity. This isn’t to make the other person feel a certain way because they don’t really care how you feel. It’s nothing malicious, but that’s the way it has to be. It’s a simple case of choosing what they want (freedom) over what you want (the relationship). You keep your cool because it makes you a stronger person. If you decide you want to be friends later it increases the possibility of that happening. Above all, it allows you to retain your personal power.

A wise man once said, “no one is responsible for how we feel except ourselves.” It is true—whether you’ve given up control a long time ago to subconscious, emotional reactions or you consciously chose your reaction, you are the only one that decides how you feel about anything. Without personal power you resign control of your emotional state to the changing tides of life and sometimes they can drown you.

## Take Advantage of Technology

If you believe that you are about to dropped or you are the one about to do the dropping, then take advantage of emotionless forms of technology like email or texting. If you want to go real old school, you could write a letter or send a singing telegram. A lot of people scoff at the idea of breaking up over technology, but the only difference is that a person loses the chance to try and change your mind with their emotions. This is the real reason people make such a big deal over about someone breaking up with them from a distance; we want to believe that crying, pleading, yelling and threatening will make the other person reconsider their position. It’s perfectly natural, but that doesn’t mean you have to go this way.

What is the real difference between breaking up in person and breaking up online? Is it really that much better than getting into a messy ordeal in person? After all, we set up so many dates via phone and text (and cancel quite a few too) that cutting off a relationship that way shouldn’t be too much of a stretch.

## Bury The Past

You don’t have to start a fire to burn down the house you shared, but you might want to get rid of anything your ex gave you. Objects become infused with emotional energy that is very powerful—if you’re like most people, the mere site of something that your ex gave you, pictures of things you did together, or even pictures of the ex will immediately push your emotional buttons and send you into an awful place. Maybe you don’t want to destroy everything so you could bury it or leave it a friend’s house until you’re over the person. Jewelry, games, pictures, clothing, underwear and the like—put all that shit in a coffin and let it sit for 8 to 12 months. Maybe then you can dig it up or maybe you’ll just want to leave it buried.

## Don’t Bang the Ex

Sex with the ex can be dope, but fuck all that noise. If it was just a casual fling that has to end, then by all means keep boning on that bridge and don’t burn it. But if you dated someone seriously, keeping the sex running after breaking up is a tough act to pull off.

For starters, your brain will think you’re still in a relationship even though you’re not. The obvious part of this is that you’ll expect the whole relationship treatment, but find yourself terribly disappointed when you don’t get it. On a subtler note, it becomes impossible to meet quality people because you’re hung up on the (false) possibility that it might workout with the ex.

Instead of getting out there to meet a new person, you’re more concerned with what the person who rejected you is doing. This causes the most irrational forms of jealously I’ve ever seen. To make the situation worse, even if you manage to get some new people in your life you won’t be able to give them your best attention because of your fixation on the ex. This can happen in the absence of post-dating hooking up, but it becomes impossible to overcome if the physical contact continues.

## Remember Exactly What You’re Losing and Act Accordingly

I remember what gave me the most pain in my last break-up. Losing the girl was awful but what I came to realize in the weeks and months following is that I lost an entire family and social network as well. This is not to say that I did not have my own social circle—it is reliable and well-established. However, the family and friends I made during the course of the relationship were effectively gone. Their allegiances were to the ex-girlfriend. I fully expected them to disown me but this expectation did not ease the pain.

I understand that some people manage to keep ties with the ex’s family (and in situations where children are involved, this probably makes the most sense) but I would wager that in a majority break up situations, keeping ties with the family is a recipe for misery—at least until you are truly over them. Which brings me to my next point.

## This takes time.

It takes a lot more time than you realize to truly get over someone. A LOT MORE. What we fail to realize is that getting over someone is a lot more than just getting into another relationship. I say that it is the ability to be in the presence of the person without feeling any change in emotion—positive or negative. They essentially are neutral to you when you think about them, see things they gave you, or even when you run into them. Until you reach that point, you run the risk of doing something extremely non-conducive to getting over the ex. You know, like number 4.

## Don’t Ask a Damn Thing

This is not the least important. It’s just the last thing I thought of. Don’t get your private-eye on and spy on their social media accounts, ask their friends what they’re doing, or turn into someone that needs a restraining order. Just let them exist in their world, and you will greatly reduce the time spent in the depressing dregs of recovery. You must treat them as if they are effectively dead.

I suppose my general take on breaking up—and I’ve got more experience than I’d like to admit on both ends of the spectrum—can be summed up like this: step out, move on, and don’t look back…or get on your back. The rest is up to you…
