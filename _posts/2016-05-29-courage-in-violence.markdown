Boxing is a poor man’s sport; most of us come from the ghetto to the ring. It’s a natural transition.

In the hood, if you’re willing to commit violence, you get respect. In boxing, the most violent man is usually the winner and the winner gets respect.

Even the loser gets respect if he fights hard and brings the heat. But unlike the street, there are rules in a boxing match.

I was at a sparring session with two rival gyms. Things were getting heated. One of the dudes sparring got caught with a shot he didn’t like and it escalated quickly. In an instant it looked more like a brawl than a match, with members from each side jumping in. Fortunately, the coaches got things under control before they got too out of control.

Then, Coach then told something I’ll never forget. He said,“If you do this shit in the street, someone’s probably gonna get killed. You kill someone in the street and you’re going to jail. But if you do it in the ring, you ain’t goin’ nowhere. Shit, they gonna clap and cheer your name if you do it during the fight.”

Eventually, everyone calmed down and the sparring session continued. The dudes were cool after that. It takes a lot of courage, skill, and discipline to get the best of a man when he is prepared and trained and ready for you and you have to meet him on equal footing. That doesn’t happen when you run up to someone and sucker punch them or take out a gun and shoot them.

Being prepared, ready for the ring is teaching a man to face his fears head on because the only advantages he can be confident of are found in training and preparation. Taking out that gun, running up to a man on the street to beat him down is a coward’s way, a moment where he faces no real possibility of defeat. That shit works if you have to go to war or save your family, but for building true character you need to build courage.

The violence inherent to a boxing match is an excellent method to build courage. There is always a winner and a loser. Even when the judges declare a bullshit draw, everyone knows that someone won and someone lost. It’s only through facing the possibility of getting hurt, losing or dying, that you can ever build actual courage. There ain’t a lot of things left in the world that lets a man face those fears and grow from facing them. Boxing is one of the few remaining forms of violence that lets you live another day while developing your courage.

The violence inherent to a boxing match is an excellent method to build courage.

Those kids at the session got into a brawl because they had learned to be violent, to take the coward’s way. Sometimes, that shit is necessary—especially in the streets. But if you wanna be better than the streets, you gotta learn to be courageous. If you want to be courageous in the face violence—where another man can legally kill you and be applauded—you can be courageous anywhere.
