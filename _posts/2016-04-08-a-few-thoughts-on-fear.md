excerpt: 'There is no way around being afraid. It’s bullshit if someone says they aren’t afraid of something. Maybe it’s low level background anxiety that they’ve learned to manage, but it always there. When you are on the verge of being pushed out of your comfort zone is when you will feel the most fear. New jobs, performing in front of others, meeting new people, risking your life (for entertainment or obligation), etc. These things push you into a realm of uncertainty. This is a place where you are not sure if you will come out better or worse, safe or harmed, or dead or alive.'

“Fear is simply the anticipation that something that’s going to happen soon needs to be prepared for.”- Tony Robbins

This definition is beautiful to me for two reasons:

1) It does not talk in terms of positives or negatives. In this way, it covers everything from the slight anxiety felt before talking to a cute stranger all the way up to something like getting into a fight with someone much bigger than you or going to prison.

2) It focuses on the cause. Not effect. By focusing on the cause, it allows you to see that all fears share the same root.

There is no way around being afraid. It’s bullshit if someone says they aren’t afraid of something. Maybe it’s low level background anxiety that they’ve learned to manage, but it always there. When you are on the verge of being pushed out of your comfort zone is when you will feel the most fear. New jobs, performing in front of others, meeting new people, risking your life (for entertainment or obligation), etc. These things push you into a realm of uncertainty. This is a place where you are not sure if you will come out better or worse, safe or harmed, or dead or alive.

It is impossible to completely eliminate fear but it can be reduced to manageable levels. There are only two paths to fearlessness: preparation and familiarity. I was once evaluated by a sports psychologist and what he found is that I am less anxious during a boxing match than before it. My explanation was similar to ones he had been given by athletes with the same result. I over-prepare so I leave as little to uncertainty as possible. Yes, there are self doubts, but they are outweighed by my preparation.

This is in line with Robbin’s explanation of fear. It’s the sign that something needs to be prepared for. It’s like an exam. If you’ve studied and you know the material, you are going to have much less anxiety than if you haven’t. Preparation means different things for different events but the idea is the same: honing the requisite skills for task you face. The better prepared you are, less fear you will experience.

Familiarity is the other fear reduction agent. If you do something enough times–surviving and learning from the mistakes you make along the way–then you stop feeling anxious about performing it. Continuing with the exam analogy, this is why the most valuable practice test are copies of the old professors exams. It allows you to become familiar with his style of testing WITHOUT incurring the true penalty of making a mistake. It’s why simulators are wonderful training. This is why sparring is so valuable for boxing.

The two feed each other. Your familiarity increases with your preparedness and vice versa. You feel most prepared when you are most familiar with the upcoming event. This reduces the uncertainty. That is the part we fear; being forced to overcome a problem in real time that we’ve never faced before. This is the message of fear: there is uncertainty on the horizon and you must prepare for it, lest you face harm to body, mind, reputation or spirit. Head that signal and you will master your fears.
