“Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.”
<br>―Lance Armstrong, *Every Second Counts*

Be willing to suffer more than your opponent. Skills are important. Knowledge of essential patterns is paramount. Great conditioning and endurance will ensure that you are ready to compete with the best. But if you want to win against other people who also have skills, knowledge and stamina, you need a world class pain threshold.

The difference between victory and defeat often comes down to who is willing to die first. By approaching every contest like it’s your last , you liberate yourself from all restrictions. All aspects of the engagement become significant. The heightened danger will require your finest execution. Failure here is failure at living. Failure here is death. Unless you want to be a loser, you will not die.

In anything worth doing it matters if you win or lose. Either way, lessons are learned but if you lose you may not be the person that reaps the benefits of those lessons. Someone coming after you, attempting where your failed, will study your case and learn from you. Instead of being elevated on the pillars of victory as a great example, your name will be whispered as a terrible warning.

Your lifetime is finite. Each second you use will never return. This means that every time you chose to take a risk and fight, it must be the most important fight in your life. Winning represents a sound investment of your time. Hopefully the fight is worth it. Losing is a waste of your life. Losing is dying.

Counter intuitively, the only way to not lose is to be willing to die. This willingness comes through in your preparation—are you working so hard that you could kill yourself? *Are you truly suffering*? During the contest are you playing to win or playing not to lose? Playing to win is is more exhausting and forces you to take bigger risks, while playing just to survive keeps you dull and conservative. You may think that saving energy for something else is a better strategy, but in that case you’ve missed the point.

If you are playing to win—playing to live—then why hold anything back? If losing means dying, why not pour your heart into everything you attempt? Holding anything back means that you didn’t want it that badly. It means that you have chosen death over success. Putting yourself through hell to achieve a goal it may feel as if you are dying—this is exactly why most people give up and sell themselves short. They are not willing to suffer to thrive. They are not willing to risk dying to live.
