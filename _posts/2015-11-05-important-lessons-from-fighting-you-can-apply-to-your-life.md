The following is a list that I originally composed for an [MMA website](http://www.standthemup.org/) I used to write for back in July 2011. I recently looked over it. It is simply amazing how much of these things are still applicable. Furthermore, I’m 4 years wise in life and I can see that these lessons—if the essence of them is applied to other endeavors in your life—will make you a better competitor and person.

* I can’t tell you how important your cardio is. You hear it all the time, but I can’t think of one other thing that will decide the outcome of most of your early fights than who is in better shape.


**If you can be persist to the end, you have a better chance to win.**

* Film everything about your training if you can. Then go back, study it and see what you’re doing wrong. One objective viewing of yourself shadow boxing is worth more than you know. Even more valuable is going over it with someone better than you. They will see mistakes you didn’t even know existed.


**The past is useful only if it is used to prepare for the future.**

* Technique is essential, but perfect technique is over rated. Effective technique is under rated. What’s more valuable: A pretty hook that almost never lands or a less than “perfect” one that has an 80% KO percentage?


**Improve the process to improve the outcome, but don’t worry too much if the outcome is not perfect if you still accomplish the general objective.**

* Pain is the great equalizer in fighting. No matter how much better than you someone is, if you can cause them pain, you stand a chance.


**All human beings have the same problems that can be manipulated: they get tired so they fatigue, they feel pain so they retreat, and they bleed so they can die.**

* The first ball shot is free. Use it wisely.


**Some rules you can break the first time and plead ignorance. Make the infraction count for something. You may not be so lucky the next time.**

-Amateurs practice things until they get them right. Professionals practice until they can’t get them wrong. The sooner you start drilling your techniques to the point of mind numbing boredom and then hours beyond–everyday–you are only taking the scenic route to mastery instead of the superhighway.

**The implications of 10,000 hour rule might be under debate, but one thing that can not be debated is the value of practice. Perfect practice makes perfect technique.**

*Whether its true or note, get started!*

* Speaking of professionals, not everyone you see fighting for money should be. Not everyone who is still amateur is unable to earn a living with their skills. Sandbagging is surprisingly common, but not as common as the former phenomena. You will reach a point where you can beat most amateurs but that does not mean you can go pro just yet. Some guys shouldn’t have declared for the draft early. Imagine how much more money they could have gotten if they gave themselves just one more year to develop.


**Sometimes you can't go backwards, so use the time you have wisely to develop when the outcome wont cost you much. Likewise, awareness of when you are.**
