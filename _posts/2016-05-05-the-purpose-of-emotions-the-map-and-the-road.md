excerpt: "Everything has a purpose. That purpose may not be profound, but you feel a variety of emotions for a reason. Emotions are your internal reaction to your external environment. Before you can have a reaction to something, you compare it to your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. You are checking to see if the way it appears is the way you believe it should be. When a situation meets expectations and you approve of it, you experience positive emotions. If the situation runs contrary to your expectations or you disapprove of it, you experience negative emotions. To summarize this,\_your emotional reaction represents the congruence between your perception and the actuality of the world."

Everything has a purpose. That purpose may not be profound, but you feel a variety of emotions for a reason. Emotions are your internal reaction to your external environment. Before you can have a reaction to something, you compare it to your own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. You are checking to see if the way it appears is the way you believe it should be. When a situation meets expectations and you approve of it, you experience positive emotions. If the situation runs contrary to your expectations or you disapprove of it, you experience negative emotions. To summarize this, **your emotional reaction represents the congruence between your perception and the actuality of the world.**

There is an old saying: “When the map and the road disagree, the map is wrong.” To appreciate the application of this saying to emotions, you must also remember that your emotions are based solely on perception. There is always more than one way to see a person or event. Our perceptions, perspectives, and beliefs—our map—are formed by what we think the world should look like. When our map is compared to the world and the world looks different, we have a choice to make. We can continue to wander around aimlessly and hope to get somewhere or we can discard the map and select a new one. Your emotions serve as a way for you to evaluate your perspective of the world around you.

## “When the map and the road disagree, the map is wrong.”

Notice that I did not include “change the road” as one of the options. This is because that can be extremely difficult and it will not increase your emotional control. Reality is very difficult to change. There are some fundamental things about people and the world that you must accept, that you must shape your strategy for living around. I could make a list of things in the world you must learn to accept and manage, but I’d never cover everything that could arise or has arisen. Instead, here’s a generally precise guide: if it falls outside of a thing you can control, then you have no choice but to accept that it’s a part of reality. **The only thing you can actually control is yourself and what you can influence is surprisingly limited.**

## Changing the road is never an option

Just because you are forced to accept something does not mean that you are forced to accept your own perception of it. This is because you have control of your perceptions and thoughts. **Changing your perception does not change the event, but it will change how you feel about it**. Since your perception of something is responsible for how you feel about it, changing your thought process about it can give you the ability to change how you feel towards it.

Let’s return to the map analogy. The road is reality and the map is our perception of reality. Our perception of events in reality lead to our emotional reaction. When the map and the road are in disagreement, it would be a waste of energy and time to try and rebuild a whole new road so that your map makes sense. The road is beyond your control, having been there long before you. It will continue to exist long after you. A more sensible course of action—one that is completely within your control—is to find a map that works better for where you want to go. The trip is the journey through life and the destination depends entirely upon what you want.

The analogy between the map and your emotions allows us to have many more useful insights into the purpose of our emotions. When we use a map to navigate to a destination, we are exerting control over the path we take.

## The road is beyond your control, having been there long before you. It will continue to exist long after you.

There are two ways a person can arrive at a destination. They can take a reactive or a proactive method. Trying to get to a place in a reactive manner means that you aren’t really sure if you’re going the best way. Instead, you adjust your path based on the things that don’t work—dead ends, getting lost, and unexp
