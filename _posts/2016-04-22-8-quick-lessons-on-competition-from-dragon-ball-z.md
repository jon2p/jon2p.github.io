If you grew up in the 80s or 90s, then you must have watched at least a few episodes of Dragon Ball Z . Even if you’re younger or older, you probably know all about it. For all the anime fans I’d like to talk about what I’ve learned about being competitive from Dragon Ball Z. If you aren’t familiar with the show you won’t get the exact references, but there is still a thing or two to learn. Maybe.

**1)** There is always someone better than you. Even if you become the best on the planet, your strongest competition might live on a another planet is on his way to earth right now to kick your ass. Actually, he might not even be born yet, but will come back in time to kick your ass. The best remedy for this is to always be ready and always be improving.

**2)** You never know what you’re made of until you take a serious ass kicking. No, really. The more epic the ass kicking the more epic your return will be and the more you know you can compete. It helps if the whole world is watching when you get beat by someone that you thought you were better than. If public humiliation after talking lots of shit doesn’t drive you to surpass your limits, you probably aren’t nearly as competitive as you thought.

**3)** Intangibles are just important as tangibles in many cases, and sometimes even more so. So what you have a higher power level than me? You better have the fighting spirit needed to crush me or you’re in for a rude awakening. Strength alone is useless. The will to destroy, dominate, compete and conquer—this is where truly powerful men come from.

**4)** Speaking of things are deceptively important, timing is really everything. Imagine if Goku died one day later in the battle against Raditz. He would have returned one day later, after Vegeta and Napa and took over the planet. The whole series would have stopped before it started. All things considered equal, the sooner you can do a thing the better off you’ll be. Especially if it’s resurrection.

**5)** If you isolate yourself from everyone for six days on a ship with nothing but the most challenging scenario to get it right, you can become really really really strong and increase your talents faster than anyone ever thought possible. We can’t all get our gravity spaceship, but imagine what would happen if you got rid of distractions for just one week and focused on nothing but your craft. You might quadruple your power level.

**6)** The real benefit of steroids isn’t how strong they make you, but actually in how fast you can recover from training. Other than the Dragon Balls, the most sought after item in the series was a little bean that let you recover instantly. Oh how great we could be if we didn’t need pesky things like sleep and time to start learning again.

**7)** The best teachers aren’t necessarily better than you or even stronger. They simply have a slightly different insight about a problem, and when it’s leveraged against what you already know it becomes a great force multiplier. Goku didn’t learn how to fight, project energy, or teleport from anyone stronger than him. But when leveraged against his own innate strength, the results were incredible. Maybe too dorky for most, but the point is in there somewhere.

**8)** Be it genetics, their environment, or their early teachers, some people are just better than you. If you worked at the same pace as them, they’ll always be ahead of you. Even if you work at a more intense pace, assuming they don’t get particularly lazy, they still will be better than you. This is no excuse to ever stop trying to out do them. The experience, lessons and abilities you develop as a result of chasing the rabbit you can’t catch will make you better than 99 percent of your competition. May luck be on your side when you face that 1 percent. Vegeta’s training to surpass Goku is legendary. Too bad it never really happened.
