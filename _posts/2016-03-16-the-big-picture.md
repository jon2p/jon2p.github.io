excerpt: 'The big picture is simple and applies to everyone: You’re going to die and there isn’t a damn thing you can do about it. And when you die–assuming you don’t invent something life changing or found a new religion–it will take approximately two generations before there is no one that remembers you ever existed. Let that sink in. The pessimistic amongst us are responding, “Well fuck it! Why don’t I just end it here and now?” You don’t end it all because you still have feelings, desires, wants and needs that you can not just shake off. It’s part of being human.'

The big picture is simple and applies to everyone: You’re going to die and there isn’t a damn thing you can do about it. And when you die–assuming you don’t invent something life changing or found a new religion–it will take approximately two generations before there is no one that remembers you ever existed. Let that sink in. The pessimistic amongst us are responding, “Well fuck it! Why don’t I just end it here and now?” You don’t end it all because you still have feelings, desires, wants and needs that you can not just shake off. It’s part of being human.

They say the only guarantee you have in life are taxes and death. Well that’s only partially true–you can evade taxes at your own peril. I’ve known more than a few people that have never paid taxes and the government never finds out. It’s not as difficult as you think. Perhaps these people might keep beating system. They might not. But they certainly aren’t going to beat death. Then it won’t matter. Nothing matters in the long run because it’s all going to end. While we don’t know what lies on the other side, we know a few fun and obvious facts about this side of the equation:

1) You can’t take shit with you
<br>2) You don’t know when you’ll be leaving
<br>3) Once you leave, you can’t check back in
<br>4) People alive can no longer affect you
<br>5) You can no longer affect them

Once it’s done, it’s done. With that said, how you spend the next 60-80 years is up to you. Life has almost no meaning in and of itself. You are born, get to kid around for a while, hit puberty and sex becomes your driving force, you may or may not reproduce and then you die. Everything else in between is whatever you want it to be–we all get the birthday cake, but we make it whatever flavor we want. You are ultimately free to do what you want to do, knowing that in long run, it doesn’t really matter. You can lead a life full of great experiences and no regrets or you can be timid and tentative. The music will stop either way. The great Jay-Z once said, “I can’t beat death so I’m trying to beat life.”

You can go smoke crack and rob people or commit to a rich and fulfilling life. I’m not telling you which to pick. My life has been such that I’ve met a lot of crackheads as well people who are successful. Even though both are going to land of no return, the guy with more non-crack related options seemed happier. We all want to be the person enjoying life on the beach. Not sleeping in an alley coming down off a crack binge.

The natural conclusion of this line of thinking is that life means nothing. And it doesn’t. When I came to this realization I counterintuitively began to place more value on things. Maybe it’s the realization that this is a one shot deal. Life is too short for most shit. This shit includes unhealthy obsessions, ridiculous interpersonal dramas, self-pity, holding gruges or sulking. All of these things lead to unhappiness and resentment. You will never lay on your death bed wishing you had done more of any of these things. You will wish you had spent more time happy and enjoying life. But the time is gone and all that you have your final hour are the memories of how you spent it. Hopefully those memories are dominated by joyful experiences.

When you feel yourself becoming down or stressed, just remember the Big Picture. See if you don’t feel a little better.
