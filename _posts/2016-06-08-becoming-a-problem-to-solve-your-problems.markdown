When faced with any type of opposition, there is one thing you can do that will always make winning significantly easier.

I have used this tool in my chess games, my boxing matches, with bullies when I was younger, and with bosses and coworkers who may have been annoying or stifling. It works in street fights and it works in civil negotiations.

The beauty of this particular thing is that, while having skill and technique help, it is not necessary to be successful when using it.

While success may not be guaranteed (are there ever any guarantees in life?), you will come out of many situations with the upper hand—if not decidedly victorious—if you do this one thing when you can do nothing else.

What is this magically simple technique that anyone, regardless of the level of skill they face in their opposition, can use to give themselves a better chance of victory?

## Become a Problem

The answer is this: become a problem. Or rather, become a problem in such a way that your opposition will flounder, clueless, attempting to effectively deal with you. By definition, you are already a problem; your existence is in the way of what someone else wants. After all, it wouldn’t be much of a fight if there wasn’t someone to struggle against and, let’s be honest, you wouldn’t be negotiating if you were already in a position to get everything you want without making concessions to another party. And, sometimes, you show up to the gunfight and your ammo is not quite what you expected. You’ve got to get creative.

I could spell it out for you, but I’ve always found examples to be an effective teaching method.

I play chess, one of the most mentally demanding games; some of the most annoying and strange situations in a chess game arise when your opponent makes some… interesting… moves that force you to reconsider your strategy. There is an expected line of play then your opponent deviates sharply from it. He moves this, you move that, he moves this, and so on. While it’s not exactly scripted, over time history has shown that certain lines of play are more effective than others. But when someone deviates from the “script,” does something out of the ordinary, you need to shift your thinking from what’s routine and expected in order to deal with this new play. This idea—forcing someone to deal with what they weren’t expecting to deal with—is key and will be revisited shortly.

You can also glean insight into this idea by considering how it works in a fight.

These days, my fighting is conducted in a manner more condoned by the public, in the ring. But, when I was younger, I was involved in more than a few street fights. I was not a violent kid naturally, but when you grow up in circumstances like I did, you quickly learn that not only are there some people that just like being ornery assholes, these people expect you kowtow to them in fear. When I was about ten or eleven years old, I got a lesson in dealing with these assholes. Back then, day after day, a new neighborhood kid would pick on me until this one day my mom had enough. She marched me back to the playground I had just been run out of and issued an open challenge to every single kid that bothered me. I think I ended up fighting five kids that day.

You’d think that’d be enough, but I think I got my ass kicked so they didn’t take me seriously. However, each time one of them started anything, we went through the same process again. If one kid started a fight, I ended up challenging every kid around that day and they either backed down or we got into a scuffle where they were beat up. Very few people enjoy being beaten, and they weren’t some of the few. It got to the point that, by the end of that summer, people were actively checking other people that attempted to fight me because it just wasn’t worth the cost of doing business.

This dude better become a problem REAL fast

I’ve seen the same thing in boxing. There was a fighter in our amateur circuit that was a big fan of holding. I mean, a little hugging is normal, but this guy took it to extremes. He’d sneak little annoying shots in while he’s doing it, making the whole fight an ugly affair. I can’t tell you how many times this style of fighting frustrated the hell out of his opponents. They got so frustrated they’d abandon the ability to concentrate effectively, thus ending up the losers. I don’t think this guy is one of the most skilled fighters ever, but he certainly had an impressive list of accolades. Most people simply don’t want to—or can’t—fight that kind of fight so they cave.

And therein lies the reason why becoming a basic, unique problem works in almost any situation. Very few people have the ability to adjust to problems in real time. They expect things to go a certain way and when there is a deviation from what they anticipated, their minds go to shit. Now, if you come against someone that is capable of making such adjustments—and these creative, dynamic individuals are few and far between in most arenas—there’s nothing you could have done to win anyway. But sometimes, it’s a good to test someone’s tolerance for an unexpected response by being problematic in an unfamiliar way.
