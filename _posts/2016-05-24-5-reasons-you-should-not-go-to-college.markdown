So it’s time to beat this horse again even though its been [killed numerous times](http://www.goodlookingloser.com/entry/college/misconceptions-about-college-part-1). At the very least we’re going to make sure it thinks long and hard before it resurrects itself for another round. My unique perspective on this issue is that I am actually in college as an adult. I fully realize there are many successful people that majored in non-stem subjects just as there are unemployed engineers (somewhere, I’m sure). But I like to play the odds that are in my favor.

If you aren’t planning to major in a STEM (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) field you should not go to college. Even if you plan on majoring in certain STEM topics (biology or anything that can remotely be considered a social science), you should skip out. College is a raw deal for most people and here’s why:

**Debt**. On average, you’re going to borrow about 6 figures. When you combine interest and cost of living, you aren’t going to make enough to deal with that financial burden unless you have a STEM degree salary. And that’s if you can find work that relates to what you studied…

**Job availability**. When it comes to finding jobs, there’s the good and there’s the bad of it. The good is that there are a lot of them. The bad is that you either can’t get them without STEM or trade training or you don’t want them because they don’t pay enough and/or have shitty hours. We live in an era that is tech and service industry heavy. If you aren’t involved in one of the skilled trades, you are almost certainly going to end up in the service industry or doing some low level administrative work. Either way, you aren’t going to make enough money to afford much of a life AND pay off that heavy debt you took out with the hope of living the life you want to lead.

**Job availability, part 2**. Working at a Starbucks some years ago, I learned something they don’t tell you in school. At the time, I was a 21 year old barista making 7.25 an hour. Every one of my co-workers, with the exception of one girl younger than me, had a college degree. This was not uncommon. A lot of baristas were making 600 a month + tip with college degrees. How does this happen? Half of it’s majoring in bullshit (i.e., not STEM) and the other half is because of the over-abundance of college educated people. If everyone goes to college and earns a degree, you no longer stand out and a college degree is worth about as much to an employer as a high school diploma was maybe fifteen years ago.

Now, your degree needs to be in something rare and difficult (like STEM); otherwise, you end up competing for a bunch of low paying jobs because that is all that is left. The low paying jobs now have two pools of applicants—those without degrees and those with. For a host of reasons (some obvious, some not), applicants with college degrees are more highly desired. The availability of jobs in other areas becomes diluted as people overload positions that require degrees like biology and social science so they then get relegated to administrative jobs and people just keep getting bumped down. These people are bumped down until they’re baristas, barely making enough for rent with 6 figures of debt.

**Skills**. You need skills to pay bills. Period. College may grant you a pretty piece of paper, but it will not necessarily teach you skills. You need to learn how to fix electronics, program a computer, repair a car, do plumbing or carpentry, or speak a foreign language if you are looking for the guarantee of a decent paycheck. As the baristas I worked with learned, there are no guarantees. On the flip side, Google is famous for hiring programmers with no formal training. Skills guarantee money. A piece of paper, however nice to look at framed and hanging in your parents’ home, will not.
