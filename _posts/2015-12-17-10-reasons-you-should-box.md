excerpt: "This past weekend I was victorious in my\_10th professional boxing match. I’ve been boxing for 8 years now: 5 as an amateur and 3 as a professional. This brings my professional record to 10-0. As an amateur I amassed a record of 41-11, won a\_state title, a\_national title, and defeated an Olympian (on a big stage but not where it counted most, sadly). My peak ranking was 4th in the nation as a superheavyweight and when I turned pro it had only slipped to 8th. I also had the very rare distinction of having a\_sponsor as amateur\_that paid all my living expenses in Los Angeles plus a pretty nice salary. So far I’ve had a pretty good career and to celebrate the important milestone, I put together a list of 10 of the most incredible results from boxing. Points from the list are the reasons I’d give someone to box. Maybe you’ll consider getting in the ring after reading them."

This past weekend I was victorious in my&nbsp;[10th professional boxing match](http://boxrec.com/boxer/641641). I’ve been boxing for 8 years now: 5 as an amateur and 3 as a professional. This brings my professional record to 10-0. As an amateur I amassed a record of 41-11, won a&nbsp;[state title](http://www.pagoldengloves.com/2012_event-schedule.html), a&nbsp;[national title](http://www.teamusa.org/usa-boxing/features/2011/october/03/2011-national-pal-results), and defeated an Olympian (on a big stage but not where it counted most, sadly). My peak ranking was 4th in the nation as a superheavyweight and when I turned pro it had only slipped to 8th. I also had the very rare distinction of having a&nbsp;[sponsor as amateur](https://vimeo.com/47127895)&nbsp;that paid all my living expenses in Los Angeles plus a pretty nice salary. So far I’ve had a pretty good career and to celebrate the important milestone, I put together a list of 10 of the most incredible results from boxing. Points from the list are the reasons I’d give someone to box. Maybe you’ll consider getting in the ring after reading them.

* **Boxing makes your confidence soar.** Confidence is the key to getting anywhere in life because if you don’t believe in yourself, then other people won’t believe in you. If you hit the weights know and think you feel good about yourself, just wait until you experience the feeling of knowing that your fists can defend you. The difference is profound. If you lift, you feel strong and think you hold your own if shit goes down. If you can box, then you might be able to stack the most plates at the gym but you KNOW you can defend yourself and anyone around you. That confidence—the problem solvers kind of confidence—can’t be gained any other way that learning how to fight.
* **Boxing teaches you to manage your adrenaline.** This is the difference between people who shine in high pressure situations and those who crumble. Adrenaline is the hormone that causes you to experience that familiar “fight or flight” feeling a.k.a. “butterflies.” Every boxer experiences this feeling before every fight or sparring session. But we perform at a high level anyway because we’ve learned how to act in spite of it. One of the biggest difference between a totally new boxer and one with some experience is that he manages his adrenaline better, thus he fights better and doesn’t get tired as quickly. Knowing how to control your adrenaline in a fight will cross over into knowing how to control your adrenaline in reality.
* **Boxing teaches you that pain ain’t shit.** Here’s a little known secret outside of boxing circles: everything in boxing is painful. Unless you win a fight by a devastating knockout, you sustain quite a bit of pain even if you win. That’s because a person trained to hurt you is trying to accomplish that objective. It’s not like dealing with hoodlum off the streets. His jabs and rights will have some steam on them. Even if you block them all—and even the best get hit—you’re going to take some hits. But it’s like Rocky said, “It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!” That’s just the getting hit part there. The training in boxing is extremely grueling and rough. ESPN ranked boxing the toughest sport to compete in and for good reason. It’s painful to train, painful to compete, but the glory is all yours.
* **Boxing gets you in real athletic condition.** Almost everyone I meet thinks they either need to do cardio or lift weights to get in shape. While doing that shit is better than doing nothing, we want to do better than nothing. I don’t think most dudes want to look like a roided up freak show any more than they want to look like a skinny Kenyan marathon runner. They want to look ripped and athletic. And probably get some confidence along the way. Boxing training is both anaerobic and aerobic. If you’re just in it for leisure and take the workout seriously, you can burn tremendous calories watching what you eat and hitting the heavy bag. If you want to compete—and I recommend every man compete in at least an amateur boxing—the training combined with all the running you have to do is going to turn you into a beast. You’ll look like an athlete with the type of body that people get themselves off to instead of a freak of nature.

* **Boxing teaches discipline.** It is impossible to get good at anything without practice. You can lie to yourself about how often you run or go to the gym, but when it comes to time to fight then the answer is going to be obvious. Unless you want to suffer the pain of embarrassment, you learn quickly to train hard every day and to eliminate distractions in your life. If you can handle the training for boxing, you can become anything you want in the world because everything else is easy in comparison. Between the punching technique, the mental concentration, toughness and physical conditioning you have to work on daily, there is no room for laziness or non-commitment.
* **Boxing teachers you how to have fun.** There’s the obvious reason: there’s nothing more exciting than slugging it out for a few rounds. It’s great stress relief and you’re getting in shape. But here’s an often overlooked point. Boxing is going be the first time many people do something where there is a very real display of progress that someone else can judge. There aren’t a lot of things left in this world where a person gets the type of challenge you find in the boxing ring. When you find something challenging, you have to stick with it because overcoming challenges is key to happiness. If you don’t have something to struggle against then you won’t have something to make you feel good about yourself. Can’t have fun if you don’t feel good about yourself.

* **Boxing teaches patience.** My coach says something to me all the time: “Bad things happen quickly. Good things tend to take a little longer.” All the progress that is made takes time and if you want things to happen quickly, you won’t last very long in training. Boxing has a way of weeding out people who expect quick fixes. Another situation that will test your patience is how long it takes before a coach starts to take you serious. Unless you are a ridiculous physical specimen, most boxing gyms will not give you much time when you first start because there are only a few trainers (in most gyms, there’s usually just one). This one trainer has to train other fighters, both professional and amateur. He might even run a few regular fitness classes. And then there’s the new guy who most likely isn’t going to stick around. You’ll have to be patient in getting attention and be patient as you improve.
* **Boxing teaches humility.**The only way to get better at this sport is to suffer. Sometimes that suffer will only be confined to road work. Other times you’ll take a beating sparring. You will lose a fight in front of a lot of people and it will embarrass the hell out of you. Especially if you get knocked out. But if you commit to the sport and focus on what you get out of it, you will not only get past these difficulties but you will also use them to become a better person and fighter. There’s nothing like a black eye, bloody nose and sore ribs to remind you that you are only human.
* **Boxing reminds you of your mortality.**Even as a fight, I see guys get knocked out or hear about guys dying and emotionally I react, “That’ll never happen to me.” Intellectually, I know that every time I step in the ring there is a chance that I come out permanently altered and not for the better. The toughness needed to fight also exposes you to the fragility of human life. You learn how easy it is to truly damage a human being. You develop a new found respect for people resilience and an empathy for people in pain. This is not to say that one develops a tolerance for weakness in others. Rather, what I have experienced is a profound appreciation for the ability for the body to persist against difficulty and the awareness that it cannot forever.

* **Boxing teaches you the true meaning of fear.** And how to deal with it. Once you deal with fighting a man that is trained to hurt you, the rest of your fears and worries seem small in the comparison. I once heard this phenomenon referred to as “drowning out the noise”. A fighter is always scared before a fight and for good reason. A person is trying to hurt you. He has a good chance of doing it. If he succeeds it will be front of everyone. The two biggest fears people have—dying and public humiliation—are imminent. All fighters experience this, but every weekend they conquer it. The constant facing and conquering of fears
