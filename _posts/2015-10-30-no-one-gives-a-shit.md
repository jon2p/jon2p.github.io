  You gotta understand something if you ever want to be something: no one gives
  a shit. This applies to everything you need or want. It applies to all the
  people in your life, including your parents and your family. It applies to
  everything in the world. No one gives a shit what you want or need. Except you.
  You’re the only person that gives a shit.

  <br><br>

  Your boss doesn’t really give a shit if you come to work or not. Sure, he cares
  if you aren’t there because that makes his job harder, but he doesn’t REALLY
  care what happens to you. It’s not malicious. He’s just got his own shit to
  worry about. That girl you want to fuck doesn’t care that you can’t get her off
  your mind. The flu or syphilis isn’t out to get you. It just took an
  opportunity to do what its gonna do and you gave it an opening.

You gotta understand something if you ever want to be something: no one gives a shit. This applies to everything you need or want. It applies to all the people in your life, including your parents and your family. It applies to everything in the world. No one gives a shit what you want or need. Except you. You’re the only person that gives a shit.

Your boss doesn’t really give a shit if you come to work or not. Sure, he cares if you aren’t there because that makes his job harder, but he doesn’t REALLY care what happens to you. It’s not malicious. He’s just got his own shit to worry about. That girl you want to fuck doesn’t care that you can’t get her off your mind. The flu or syphilis isn’t out to get you. It just took an opportunity to do what its gonna do and you gave it an opening.

People care about themselves and how a situation is gonna increase what’s valuable to them. If you get that sentence, you’ll never have a problem in this world again. It’s so important that I’m gonna write it again, phrased differently, and in bold letters. **No one gives a shit about you unless you increase what is valuable to them**.

Before you start talking that shit about people who do volunteer work or charity, reread the bold face. Those good souls that donate their own time, money and energy are doing it because it increases feelings that they personally find valuable. And even still, it’s not so much they give a shit about you personally as they care about the feelings they get from helping. Maybe that feeling is warm and fuzzy, acceptance by their God, or the relief of a tax write off. It’s still done to benefit themselves. You’re desires are secondary.

Same with that girl you’re mentally undressing. She doesn’t give a shit that you think she’s sexy. That’s not gonna make her want to get nasty with you. What’s in it for her? Are you good looking? Are you interesting? Do you have money and status? What do you bring to the table that is valuable to her?

If you want more from the world you have to give more to the world. The world doesn’t owe you shit and no amount of sulking or protesting will ever change that fact. Everything you want is there for you to take if you are willing to pay the right price—and I ain’t talking about money.

Maybe the lifestyle you want is only possible with a job that requires selling ability. Go become a damn good salesman. Maybe you want to be well connected to the most famous and powerful people. Well those people have a lot to offer and so you better come with something that makes you powerful and famous. If you want a sexy and intelligent girl, you better bring the body of Adonis with the mind of Einstein. Because here is the second part of this dirty secret that no one tells you: **Whatever you want, you are getting it from an auction; not a department store**.

You’re gonna be competing with people for a lot of shit. Not everything is winner take all or zero sum, but it’s best to go after it like it is. You have to compete. The right way. When you go after what you want in a competitive manner, you raise your level so high that ultimately you end up in a position to take advantage of other favorable opportunities of a similar quality. Maybe you don’t get that job, or that girl, or get into that school: but now you’re good enough to get into comparable or even BETTER situation.

But the bottom line is that the money you want, the girls you like, the experiences you desire—they don’t give a shit about you. They give shit about what you bring to the table to show you are worth their time. Knowing this, there is no reason why you can’t have anything you want. All you have to do is be willing to pay the price.
