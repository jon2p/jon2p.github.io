excerpt: 'Escalation of force. The standard of force continuum. Rules of engagement. Regardless of the name it goes by the concept is the same: use no more force than necessary to neutralize opposition. There is a beautiful poem of sorts in martial arts that sums up this idea neatly.<br><br> “It is better to avoid than to block, It is better to block than to strike, It is better to strike than to hurt, It is better to hurt than to maim, It is better to maim than to kill, It is better to kill than to be killed, All life is precious and none can be replaced” <br><br> You do what you have to do to stop someone from hurting you, but no more than that. Compassionate aggression. Damage control. Do just enough to stop your opponent from hurting you. Force escalation is practiced to avoid damage that could ultimately result in an unnecessary fatality. For the less compassionate in the audience–the ones all about throwing blows in a vocal confrontation, stomping a dude out that’s already down, or even dumping a box of bullets into a guy that got the best of you–there is a more practical reason for following this code. If you can’t justify your use of force in a court of law, then you could get anything from aggravated assault to manslaughter. The length of time varies, but jail is jail and all of you reading this should be saying “fuck that!”'

Escalation of force. The standard of force continuum. Rules of engagement. Regardless of the name it goes by the concept is the same: use no more force than necessary to neutralize opposition. There is a beautiful poem of sorts in martial arts that sums up this idea neatly.

“It is better to avoid than to block, It is better to block than to strike, It is better to strike than to hurt, It is better to hurt than to maim, It is better to maim than to kill, It is better to kill than to be killed, All life is precious and none can be replaced”

You do what you have to do to stop someone from hurting you, but no more than that. Compassionate aggression. Damage control. Do just enough to stop your opponent from hurting you. Force escalation is practiced to avoid damage that could ultimately result in an unnecessary fatality. For the less compassionate in the audience–the ones all about throwing blows in a vocal confrontation, stomping a dude out that’s already down, or even dumping a box of bullets into a guy that got the best of you–there is a more practical reason for following this code. If you can’t justify your use of force in a court of law, then you could get anything from aggravated assault to manslaughter. The length of time varies, but jail is jail and all of you reading this should be saying “fuck that!”

So aside from the practical implications–like staying out of prison–there is another reason you don’t want to overdue it when you take down opposition in your life. Every action in human affairs provokes a reaction of unknown force that is limited only by the power of those to react. There are times when you have to block, hurt, maim or maybe even kill. This could be in business, interpersonal relationships or daily life. Figurative and literal situations apply. But if you focus on achieving your objective instead of destroying the other person, then you might save yourself the wrath of new a enemy. On the other hand, he still might hate you anyway.

This is the risk you take whenever you block someones path or strike them down. Even if it’s necessary, you never meet a villain that feels like he needs to be stop. But sometimes the villain can become your ally. A crushed rival will remember not only how you beat him, but how you behaved once your hand was raised in victory. You’ve already won! There is no need to throw salt in a lethal wound.

It’s amazing how many people make enemies in situations where nothing is gained at all. You might have to strike an opponent, but you don’t have to maim or kill him. This increases the chances that he comes for revenge. Or his friends may come for revenge. Hell knoweth no fury than an opponent driven by hatred rather than necessity. No one knows the future. Overly shamed or overly hurt opponents become enemies who will use their own methods and resources to balance the emotional scales. No man knows the hour and intensity of his own revenge.

## You’ve already won! There is no need to throw salt in a lethal wound.

When you have to stop an opponent, do what’s necessary and respect your adversary. If he becomes a bitter enemy anyway, there is nothing you could have done. Just don’t make an enemy out of the fallen if you don’t have to. The difference between those who graciously accept defeat and those who plot revenge is often how the victor handles the temporary shift of power. The enemy you avoid making today could be your ally tomorrow. Or your executioner.
