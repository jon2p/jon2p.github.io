excerpt: "This is a common question in sports. When I played football the coach would ask this\_whenever there was a someone feeling set back by the pain that inevitably came with the game. “Are you hurt or are you injured?” Both conditions result in discomfort and pain, but there is a difference. You can continue to play through being hurt. It’s merely a matter of pain tolerance. It may be intense, but its not debilitating. Injury is debilitating. Injury is an actual change in your condition that prevents performance. You can not play through injury."

This is a common question in sports. When I played football the coach would ask this whenever there was a someone feeling set back by the pain that inevitably came with the game. “Are you hurt or are you injured?” Both conditions result in discomfort and pain, but there is a difference. You can continue to play through being hurt. It’s merely a matter of pain tolerance. It may be intense, but its not debilitating. Injury is debilitating. Injury is an actual change in your condition that prevents performance. You can not play through injury.

This is a way to keep perspective on pain you experience in your life. In applies to physical pain as well as mental and emotional turmoil. Remember; pain is the response to something being wrong. There are some wrongs that are uncomfortable to deal with. Some may even be excruciating, but you can still endure and perform. There is no need for you to exaggerate your response to the pain. You just have to deal with it. You are more capable than you know.

## What’s important is keeping the pain in life in perspective.

And then there are the injuries. These are the things that you need time out of the game to recover from. When you are injured, continuation–even if its nearly painless–is not possible. Sometimes being injured is more painful than being hurt. Sometimes it less. This is why some people over react to merely being hurt, believing that it’s time to sit a few plays out. If you react to being hurt as if it’s injury, you become more dramatic than necessary. A molehill of a inconvenience turns into a mountain of epic proportions.

The best and worst things in life walk hand in hand. There is no pleasure without pain. Seek to avoid one, and you forfeit your experience of the other. What’s important is keeping the pain in life in perspective. Some things merely hurt you–a lot–but they don’t destroy. Many times the pain actually makes you more capable in the future–if you react to it with the proper perspective. But it does not debilitate. When you are injured–when you truly are broken–this is not time for despair and melodrama either. The only response then is to rest and to heal up for another day of fighting when you can overcome of the pain of merely being hurt.

Emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually. Hurt or injury is possible in any of these areas because pain is possible in any of these areas. There is no shame in retreating from the battle if a loss is inevitable. Live to fight and overcome another day. However, you will die a thousand cowardly deaths if it is only pain that defeats you.
