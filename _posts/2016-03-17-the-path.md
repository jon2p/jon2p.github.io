  Once many a many year ago<br>

  To forge heart, body, mind and soul<br>
  And cleanse weaknesses past.

Once many a many year ago
<br>I started on a task
<br>To forge heart, body, mind and soul
<br>And cleanse weaknesses past.

Nothing’s able to break the man
<br>Who gambles on his last
<br>Nothing’s able to shake the man
<br>Alone blazing this path.

Lessons learned are so numerous
<br>With no definite end
<br>The only thing that’s certain is
<br>You’ll die or take them in.
<br>Strong metaphors for living well
<br>Learned hurting other men
<br>Strong metaphors for living well
<br>Learned struggling within.

Nothing counters so skillfully
<br>As a well thought out plan
<br>And few things can hit harder than
<br>Critiques from watchful men.
<br>We learn nothing test stamina
<br>Like abstaining from a vice
<br>We learn nothing test stamina
<br>Like living a well life.

Many years later down the path
<br>Wearily traveled far
<br>Weighed down with heavy heart and soul
<br>From battles won and lost.
<br>Stronger than me that came before
<br>Done in a record time
<br>Stronger than me that came before
<br>A new life that is mine.
